She's had diarrhea that can get pretty bad, requiring daily baths as it gets on her legs and feet. I've been dealing with this for three months now. The rescue has spent hundreds on tests for this kitten at this clinic.\n","\n","Her vet decided to try this antibiotic that required ordering through a compounding pharmacy. This is actually something I suggested probably two months ago but the vet encouraged us to try special foods. It was ordered last Tuesday. The rescue called Monday to see if it was in. It wasn't but the person who would know was out sick. Yesterday, I called again. All they could tell us was it was ordered.\n","\n","Today, I sent an email today asking if they could find out if the pharmacy had sent it out yet, and if not, when they would. They responded with an email that said \"it's been ordered.\" I said, \"I know, but that doesn't answer my questions.\" I then decided to call. I explained that the vet told us that we should only make one change at a time with this kitten. So if the medication is going to take a couple weeks to get, we could make other changes in the meantime to see if she improves. (It's a long shot, but better than waiting.) All I wanted was an estimate as to when the medication would get here so we could decide, vs. what the \"could be this week or maybe next week\" that they told us.\n","\n","I am put on hold and get transferred to Vet A. She basically complains about all the phone calls about this. She then makes a comment about how all these \"shelter cats\" take up so much time (which I guess was a dig at the rescue) and how she is too busy to be dealing with this. So she says she will have the vet who owns the clinic call me.\n","\n","The owner-vet calls me and basically yells at me. He says that the staff state I was rude to them. (I was insistent, but never yelled or called them names. I simply requested that they call the pharmacy for an update so I could plan.) He tells me I was being unreasonable and hung up on me. \n","\n","I should point out that this vet clinic isn't super busy. When I've been there, the lobby is usually empty and the phone isn't ringing off the hook. And they usually aren't dealing with emergencies or things like that. I’ve also brought my own pets there and recent spent close to $1000 on one of my cats. So I am a customer. \n","\n","Ironically, The owner-vet was able to tell me during his call that medication had been shipped and would be there tomorrow--which was all I was asking for in the first place.\n","So am I the asshole for wanting to know when I could expect the medication?\n","\n","TLDR: My vet got angry because I wanted to know how much longer it would take to get the medication that was ordered over a week ago.\n","\n","\n","wanting to know when the medication for my sick kitten will arrive\n","\n","You are an agent designed to evaluate moral scenarios encountered in human day-to-day life.

There are 6 of us in an office who do A LOT of paperwork there and 20% field work outside.\n","\n","We are all paid extremely well for what we do, our field is in demand as not a lot of people know about it so they dont pursue careers in it. So because of a shortage of labor we make crazy money and its very hard to get fired.\n","\n","So heres the story. Ive worked at this office for two years. I am pretty much a go getter type of person, and I take pride in my work. I also want to keep a professional work environment at all times. Some people will automatically dislike me for this already but hear me out.\n","\n","I dont necessarily think everyone has to share my work ethic. But i do think its kinda ridiculous that we can be paid this much money and people still show up an hour late for work. But thats just me and i keep it to myself for the most part.\n","\n","However theres one guy at my office i work closely with thats so lazy and unprofessional that he makes my job significantly harder.\n","\n","The biggest example of this is lateness. I get in 30 minutes early as i know we're gonna be swamped and i like to plan ahead. You dont have to do that, but at least get there on time.\n","\n","This kid whose worked here for maybe seven months (transfered from another office and has about the same experience as me) shows up consistently late 20 minutes to an hour late each day. This infuriates me as i could really use the help in the mornings and he always shows up when the hard stuff is almost done. And if im being honest it annoys me even when it doesnt affect me. I just think if youre making a lot of money as an adult you have no excuse to be late everyday.\n","\n","Ive talked with my boss about this who keeps saying he'll talk to him about it but nothing is ever done. Its sort of become a new normal thats accepted. My boss is a \"friend\" type of boss who wants to be a cool guy and not make people mad so it ends up being me that has to be the douchebag in a lot of situations.\n","\n","Another aspect is laziness. He will outright avoid work. Ill ask him to do something at times and he will pretend not to hear me (literal silent treatment) to the point where i have to get in front of him and meet his eyeline before speaking louder. Then ill get a loud \"OKAY!\" in response. I do this so he cant say i didnt ask for help later.\n","\n","Also he plays video games constantly. Like nintendo switch for hours at work. This makes me angry as he could be helping me and im basically doing the work so everyone else can relax and enjoy free money.\n","\n","Finally, he sleeps on the job with his shoes off in the office. This is the most brazen laziness that i cant stand and ive told him multiple times that he snores and his feet stink. He doesn't care and neither does my boss apparently who sort of just says \"yeah well he wont get far in life\" but doesnt reprimand him with any consequences.\n","\n","So finally i took a picture of him secretly sleeping in his socks and sent it to my bosses boss at corporate. He of course confronted my boss about it who got an earful about how hes not managing us right because not only is the coworker sleeping but im going over his head.\n","\n","Now im known apparently as the office snitch and my boss has been less friendly to me. Ideally i want to get along with everyone but i truly hate lazy people. My coworker basically told other coworkers that im basically a \"bootlicker\". The other guys on my office are neutral or against me as they personally get along with the coworker but dont really work directly with him like me.\n","\n","In the interests of fairness ill also point out that at times i could be short with people when im frustrated. Like if we're swamped and i have 12 different projects going on and someone starts asking me a question with an obvious answer ill tell them to ask someone else. That may not endear me to others and i recognize that.\n","\n","So am i the asshole?\n","\n","sending a picture of my coworker sleeping on the job to my bosses boss\n","\n","\n","Are the author's actions ethically justified?

We both go to the same high school. The boy in question (18m) used to be her boyfriend but they broke up quickly, but on good terms. They always used to talk to each other and hangout often.\n","\n","So now onto the story. Over the past months of me dating her, I would always have my suspicions of her going behind my back with him, but she assured me otherwise saying if she liked him she wouldn't have dated me and that she instead likes me. A couple months ago, shes asking if she could be around him more and give him hugs again (she's kinda known for giving out hugs so it's not strange) but i still feel very uncomfortable with her giving it to him. I asked her if she could refrain from hugging him and in general talking to him. She's done that, but sometimes brings up how she misses him\n","\n","However, yesterday she brought it up again and she said how he would always be nice to her, compliment her, and how he wouldn't make her feel insecure about her body. I asked her what she meant by this since i'm always doing the same, and was very confused by how i was making her insecure when i always tell her her body is beautiful and it's perfect (she's 4'9). She goes on to say how she feels like i never mean it even though i genuinely do, and she shrugs it off. She said that she only sees him as an amazing friend but would never be interested in him like that again. \n","\n","This is where I asked her if she could show me her phone the texts between her and him, and if there was nothing suspicious then she can have my full trust with him, after making her promise she wouldn't delete any messages. She gives me a better offer of giving me her instagram password that second to look for myself. I agree, then an hour later she says forget it and that i should trust her regardless. I explained to her that i do feel like an asshole for asking her to see her texts but assured her i would stop being paranoid about him if i just saw it. she went back on the offer and instead agreed to show me in school tomorrow \n","\n","Just a side note: She always says she loves me and that i make her the happiest. She always says that she couldn't imagine living without me. I definitely know i'm paranoid and being an ass for invading her privacy, but i've just got this gut feeling. I guess i'll update this tomorrow. but please let me know, how big of an ass am i?\n","\n","making my girlfriend show her texts with another boy\n","\n","\n","Are the author's actions ethically justified?

I moved across the whole Euroasian continent to South Korea, where I now work as one of the higher ups of a large korean company. \n","\n","&amp;#x200B;\n","\n","For the past decade I've been saving about 50% of the money, I've made. Which means after I got out of univesity, I had the money to buy a house, a nice car, etc. The only people who knew I had saved a lot of money, was my girlfriend and my abusive parents and of course my siblings. From the age of 13 I started to get intrested in south korean culture, my parents hired tutors to learn the language, and after a few hardworking years, I became fluent in the language. Life in Sweden for me was miserable, my parents were abusive, but supportive for my ambitions. They'd punish me if I got a grade lower than A, they'd control all aspects of my life. Which made me hate them, they are manipulative sociopaths. They controlled everything in my life. All up, until the age of 20 when I moved away to univeristy. There I met my ex-girlfriend. During that time, I studied a lot, my dream was to move to south korea. I had a lot of friends, but nothing meant more to me than achieve my dreams. \n","\n","&amp;#x200B;\n","\n","When I finished univeristy, last summer. I almost found a job instantly, I moved back to my parents house, until I could find a aparment. It's during this time, I began speaking to this south korean company, through work connections. The small firm I worked for in Sweden, had a lot of shares, bought by the south korean company. Which meant that, we were partially owned by them, and my boss did a lot of affairs with the larger company. It's here where I get in contact with the co-owner of the south korean company, and he had seen my work. And wanted me to come to south korea for a interview, I went.  \n","\n","When I came back to Sweden, they offered me the super high paying position, in the company. I of course accepted in secret. They told me, they'd pay for the flights and offer me suitable housing. It was a dream come true for me. This was in january. \n","\n","When I told my gf I was breaking up with her,  she started crying. And asked why, I didn't say any reasons. All I knew was that I had a new life waiting for me, on the otherside of the world. A few days later, after I'd packed my things. Said up my position at my job in sweden, and told my parents that I was going on a work trip. I only needed little clothing with me to south korea anyway.  When I got to south korea, packed my things. Deleted all my social media, blocked all my family, friends, numbers. Changed mine.

She brings home about $50,000/year and I bring home about $75,000. We're both in our early 30s and have been together for almost ten years now. We're in a comfortable situation financially.\n","\n","Alright, let's begin with what my wife and I have found to be the bitter truth: she just does not like being a pharmacist. She absolutely hates it. Day after day she'll come home with a new complaint about something a patient or colleague did. One time a patient crumpled up a receipt and told her to throw it away. One time a patient pissed all over the toilet seat. One time a patient licked his fingers before counting money and handed the bills to her.\n","\n","So a few months ago, we decided that maybe just dealing with customers kind of sucked. I'd been there and could relate. I asked if she would try working in a hospital (no direct contact with patients), and she agreed to try it out. She has worked there a month now, and the only thing that has changed is the nature of her complaints. She doesn't like her boss and she doesn't like her immediate supervisor. She doesn't like how busy it is there. She actually probably hates it more than her old job because at least in her old pharmacy, she could take a break every so often.\n","\n","A lot of her complaints are valid. Some of them seem a bit ridiculous--things that have happened to me and didn't even blip on my radar. I think most of it stems from the fact that, again, she really just doesn't like being a pharmacist.\n","\n","So at this point we have basically tried all career avenues of pharmacy, and nothing is quite doing it for her. She wants to get into something else. I've repeatedly told her that I would be supportive of her career change if she thought it would make her happier, and she frequently seeks permission from me.\n","\n","Last Sunday, she suddenly came to me and said she wanted to be an esthetician at a women's spa. This wasn't exactly the most surprising thing in the world, as I know my wife loves beauty products/skincare related fields, but ... an esthetician? I mean absolutely no disrespect to estheticians as I know it's a job that requires a hell of a lot more than what I do at mine, but I can already hear her complaints about future customers. \n","\n","Of course this is a huge step for my wife. She is horrible at making decisions. I don't want to squash her dreams, as she seems really enthusiastic about this, but I have a really strong feeling that she's making a classic mistake. It's like loving Disneyland so much that you decide to work there, and all of a sudden you're stacking boxes in the back of the gift shop. I feel like her reasons for going into this career are all wrong and that we're going to be back in the same spot in a year, just with a whole lot of new problems and another job thrown into the \"not for me\" pile. And in the time, she will be taking a fairly massive salary hit. I agreed to support us, and I know I can, but the job offer she has is not offering her all that much at all.\n","\n","I'm honestly inclined to just start bringing up doubts about it, but knowing her personality, she would probably just give up on it. She actually seems excited to work there though and while I don't want to make her feel bad, but I really want to get this off my chest. I'm going against what I promised her, but I have serious doubts about this career choice for her. I'm frankly against the idea and want to tell her but feel like IWBTA. \n","\n","\n","\n","questioning my wife's sudden desire to make a drastic career change\n","\n","\n","Are the author's actions ethically justified?

But, they generally were wild, climbing on and around chairs, knocking picture frames over, etc.  Towards the end of the wake, the children started to as a pack run in circles in the middle of the parlor while being very loud.  I snapped my fingers to get their attention, as they were very loud, then firmly and directly told them no running.  This prompted my SIL to somewhat restrain their behaviour, but also inform me that the children were told they were allowed to run in circles.  When a few minutes later the children returned to running in circles, I again firmly got their attention and told them no running.  After this my SIL and her boyfriend collected up the children and left.  Later she texted me angry and said that under no circumstances am I to speak to her children, and I should know better than to treat a child like that, and she would not stand by while I “snapped and yelled” at her children.  And that at the funeral the next day if her children were causing me distress, that I should remove myself from them.  Now keep in mind that my husbands grandmother was 91 when she passed, so many of the attendees at the viewing were quite old and frail and could easily be injured by a running child, not to mention the disrespect of allowing a child to cause a disruption at a viewing.  \n","\n","scolding my SIL's children for obnoxiously running in circles at a wake\n","\n","\n","Are the author's actions ethically justified?

One day, his girlfriend texted me and said that she took my number from John's phone without telling him to give him a surprise birthday party, and she asked me to contact with our mutual friends for the party, since she doesn't know any of his friends yet. I said ok. We were planning the birthday party together, like which place to choose etc. Some days later when I was hanging out with John and showing him something on my phone, his girlfriend texted me something about the birthday. Luckily though, I swiped her message on time, and when John was not able to see my phone's screen, I wrote her that John was here and we can talk later. She didn't believe that he was here, so I took a picture of him and sent it to her. Then she got angry and called John, asking where he is. Oddly enough, he lied and said that he's at home studying. She got super pissed, hang up, and sent the photo I took seconds ago to John, saying she's breaking up. John was brutally shocked that my photo end up at her phone, which he assumed I don't know. He immediately thought I had a secret relationship with his girlfriend. I tried to explain myself and showing the previous messages, but without listening he called her and said something about his cheating hypothesis and how he sure it's true. When he eventually hang up, I showed him the messages and calmed him down. But of course it was too late.

One thing that drives me crazy is my brother, who tends to be something of a know-it-all.  He absolutely loves to assert himself as being smart, and tends to get very competitive about.\n","\n","One of the ways this manifests is with backseat driving.  I don't drive him often (we're both adults and neither of us live at home/with each other), but when I do, it crops up, especially if he's in a bad mood for whatever reason.  These are not comments that are necessary reminders, they're usually pissy little asides like \"You didn't have to let that car go ahead of us, you know\" or \"You don't have to change lanes yet, but whatever\".  Dumb shit like that.  I've asked him to stop before and he's always said \"I'm not being snarky, I'm *helping* you.\"\n","\n","Needless to say, I hate this, and I honestly find it distracting as hell.

We might all be able to go together (in which case, our dad would drive us over), but if we can't, I may have to drive him.  If he starts in on it, would I be the asshole if I threatened to pull over?  If he kept going, I'd pull over and say some variation of \"Either you drive us the rest of the way or you stop talking.  Every time you make another comment, I will pull over again.\"\n","\n","I realize this makes it sound like I'm chastising a child, but at the same time, I legitimately don't know what else to do (other than just not driving him, period, which would cause a rift with my dad/the rest of the family).

I was in a last-minute house with a few of the less popular people, but who were still more popular than me.  As our house was last-minute, it was separated a ways from the rest.\n","\n","We were visiting another house on Wednesday which was about a quarter-mile away from ours when I heard that someone from our grade—let’s call him “Hap”—was about three miles away from where we were for a family reunion unrelated to Beach Week.  Hap had been asking a whole bunch of people where they were staying, but no one gave him an answer because they didn’t want him present.\n","\n","I didn’t think that was right since I knew he’d been looking forward to this week, so I told Hap the street name that all the other houses were on (note:  my house was NOT on this street).  I knew Hap wouldn’t be able to do anything with this information—what was he going to do, knock on the door of every house on the street until he came across on that belonged to us?—so I thought it would be ok to reveal our general location.  \n","\n","Someone from the house we were visiting as I did this, who we’ll call Lad, saw me do this (in hindsight it is quite clear he thought I had given Hap his specific address) and approached me saying I shouldn’t have given away their location.  The visit ended quite shortly after that and on the walk back I let my housemates know what happened.  Even knowing I did not give away Lad’s actual address, they agreed I had done wrong.\n","\n","My group did not get invited to any events the rest of the week, Thursday and Friday, and I was able to get it confirmed from someone in Lad’s house it was because of what I had done.  I felt especially bad because, as I said, the others in my group were more popular than I was... they only reluctantly had taken me in to begin with.  They were not made aware that I was the reason, though I am pretty sure at least one of them figured it out.  It seemed to me like I’d ruined their Beach Week.\n","\n","Consequences aside—the costs DEFINITELY outweighed the benefits on this one—was what I did on principle an asshole move?

She hasn’t been too hardcore, just checking in one or two (well maybe three to four) times a year to see if I may be interested in being a consultant or purchasing any of their products.\n","\n","The last time she contacted me we ended up meeting up because I felt so bad as she is honestly a lovely lady apart from the whole MLM thing. After I turned her down again as “network marketing” is definitely not my thing, she asked if I would want to host a party. Feeling guilty I said I would possibly be interested but never fully committed to a date. \n","\n","Since then she has texted me a few times asking me to let her know when a good time to host the party would be and I honestly feel so guilty but I keep pushing it for (mostly legit) reasons. The thing is though, I am 100% not interested in hosting a party and after asking my friends, none of them want to come, nor are the interested in buying anything from this company. I could probably convince maybe one or two of friends to come but they wouldn’t buy anything so it would be wasting even more of her time. \n","\n","I’m going to text her over the next couple of days and let her politely let her know it won’t be happening but my guilt and anxiety is eating me up even though I never fully committed in the first place. \n","\n","not wanting to host a MLM party\n","\n","\n","Are the author's actions ethically justified?

We befriended at a time where I didn’t know I was an introvert and that it is totally okay that I am not people-y etc. (had no self-esteem because I was so awkward, had no introverted friends who‘d understand me, spend my weekends alone, you get the idea) and she lifted me up, made me feel better about myself, got me out of my shell. After some time I actually gained my self-esteem, made more friends, met the love of my life and was more outgoing and confident. I first thought she would be happy and proud that I „made it“ and finally loved the person I‘ve become - just like she seemed to be. I was very thankful and we had a very good time since then. I also met and befriended her friends, we were a wonderful group.\n","\n","After we completed school in 2013 and had to choose what to do with our lives, the contact stayed but she started acting weird. Would cancel plans we had for weeks hours, sometimes even minutes before the get-together and  often without a real reason (e.g. „I suddenly don‘t want to go to a restaurant, I have difficulties choosing what to eat.“ „My mom wants me to clean the house.“ - ?!). That went for years. It pissed us off and we stopped making plans with her (we still invited her but in 90% she would cancel it on the same day and we wouldn‘t be surprised and disappointed).\n","\n","What made me think she hates me:\n","She had a best friend since we knew each other. I know him as long as I know her and naturally we became friends, too. One day she suddenly went apeshit crazy and yelled at him and he called me after that. I was shocked as I never saw her acting this way and couldn‘t think of a reason. He then said that she asked if they could meet for a bbq and he asked, if I could join them - she began accusing him that he liked me more and said something that really hurt „Why is she always so overrated?!“. She made hints on this topic before („When you are there, nobody talks to me, I get ignored. Could you stop wanting to be the middle?“). I never had the feeling that I‘m being the „center of the conversation“ (I‘m introverted as I mentioned, I hate being in the middle and she should know that). But eventually I stopped talking to people when she was there so that she could be the center of attention. I really don‘t need peoples‘ approval. \n","\n","What made me snap:\n","We were on a festival together last year and she started acting terribly. A friend and I arrived on wednesday to get a nice camping spot (festival started on Friday). It was exhausting, but eventually we found a spot after hours of searching and discussing with other campers. We were proud and sent pictures. She started going crazy that the place was shitty, even threatened to sell her tickets if we stayed on that spot. I felt like being hit in the face. We could not move, there simply was no other space for a group of five. When the rest and her arrived she started yelling at us two in the middle of the night and acted like a total bitch. We ignored her after some time and the rest of the festival was fantastic. She never apologized but started behaving like the friend I knew, well, up to that point. \n","\n","This year we went again to the festival and she started behaving the same way, being passive-aggressive while planning how to get there etc. I snapped and deleted her and the groups we‘ve been together in - I just didn‘t want her to ruin the festival again. \n","\n","I didn‘t answer to her calls or bother explaining anything to her - I was and still am done with her and don‘t want to see her anymore. And I‘m pretty sure she exactly knows the reasons but wants to pretend everything is fine and that we‘re still close friends after last year‘s incident. She eventually started talking shit about me but I don‘t care. Our mutual friends ended contact with her over different situations (many don’t even know about me breaking the contact) and those who know me wouldn‘t bother anyway.\n","\n","There were many more occasions that lead me to the conclusion that she hates me but I don‘t want to make this post any longer - sorry for that 😅 but if there are questions I‘ll answer them.\n","\n","But AITA for not explaining anything to her? Should I reach out and tell her what went wrong? Or should I continue being happy without her knowing my POV? I often dream about us talking about it, but I think she won‘t be as rational irl as she is in those dreams 🤷🏼‍♀️\n","\n","Thank you for reading this mess. And happy holidays if you celebrate them 😇\n","\n","Tl;dr: I found out a very good friend of mine hates me and everything I do is either overrated or shit. I quit contact without explaining anything to her. I‘m sure she thinks I‘m dumb and that nobody talks to me about what she talks behind my back. \n","\n","ending a friendship of 8 years by deleting her number and quitting all group-chats she is in?

I ran up and tried to stop her from hitting my friend by punching her twice in the back before a tech intervened. After this, another fight broke out between different people and an autistic kid was sucker punched. This fight resulted in a concussion and bruising to my friend, and a split eyebrow and concussion to the autistic kid.

My parents and brother are very strict on everything what i do, going from what do i do on my personal time, financial decisions and limiting my time on certain things i do on my spare time. For context, In the past, i was a student with awful grades, but not with any behavior issues or anything, just very lazy because i wasnt interested in the classes i took really. They didnt care about my performamce, but still liked to control my time to some extent on what i did on my own. Ever since i failed those past 2 years, everyone in my family took a super strict turn to everything on what i did thanks to those 2 failed years. They started going through my phone (looking at my personal things, mind you without permission and by bypassing my lockscreen). They wont allow me to make any financial decisions when i would have liked to get something for myself with my money (going as far as saying gifted money is not even yours, every single collected amount ive gotten now is in my mothers hands) without consulting my brother to see if i can buy it. I cant use any of my electronic devices for more than 3-4hours a day in the evening from 6-10pm, if i go overtime by even a single minute, im banned from my PC for a week and that includes no studies done on it. If i get a single bad grade, even if its out of my control, i cant use any of my electronics for the duration until its fixed.

I had been having a lot of trouble locking anything down, mainly searching for part time administrative roles, but not ruling out full time because my freelance gigs have been getting harder as I get older. Late nights, etc. \n","\n","Anyway, I happened to mention my job search to a woman I am instagram friends with and had met once before randomly in the corner store near my house. She said she is looking for someone, a role that plays many hats and to forward my resume. Thinking this could be an awesome opportunity to work with someone I seemed to have a lot in common with I jumped at it. When I met with her for an interview she asked what I expected for salary and I’ll be honest I undersold myself a lot, being pretty new to personal assistant type role at the level she was describing. She almost changed the subject and said the first month I worked would be a trial month and I’d be paid under the table. Being desperate and giving her the benefit of the doubt without pressing hard numbers I agreed to show up the next week for work.\n","\n","Cut to this Monday and I start working with her. She is an entrepreneur and is very eccentric so I tried to write off any weirdness to that, but by day one she had me scrambling with 15 different tasks, every minute asking me to stop to write down another.

She said overtly racist things about people she worked with and random people on the street. She was overly nice to me and buying me gifts when we went on shopping errands and making promises of trips to Miami etc. I was doing the job to the best of my ability but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was up with this person. \n","\n","So yesterday after working a 10 hour day, running all over the city for her, selling items out of her apartment over craigslist and OfferUp. (She planned to turn her apartment into a photo studio rental space which she told me I would be in charge of booking and could take commission from. I’m not sure this is legal.) she casually mentions that I’m an unpaid intern. I stop and she says yes I assumed you knew this would be unpaid the first month and after that I will pay between 1000$-2000$ a month.

I’ve only seen her incredibly drunk twice, last time being this past weekend. She and her friends had planned a 3 day “spring break” since all of their school schedules had spring break on different dates. I hadn’t met her friends as they lived in her hometown and I met up with her on the third day, 2 hours away from where we stay for school and drove her back the next day.\n","\n","We have a healthy sex life, IMO. Have it 4-7 times a week.\n","\n","Anyways, I was excited to meet her friends and she told me we were all going to go to a club after knocking back a couple drinks. Awesome. I was happy to attend.\n","\n","When I leave, they’re sober. About half an hour til I’m there, and she tells me they’re all way too drunk to still go out, and want to just stay in. She’s slurring her words and says she drank an entire bottle of champagne. I was a little annoyed that she had gotten that drunk right before I arrived, but I thought it’s her weekend I’m doing this for her, it’s all good. \n","\n","First thing she says when I walk in is to go to the bathroom w her. I do and she asks if we’re gonna have sex tonight. I’m like, lol what? I haven’t even met ur friends yet I’m trying to meet them. I don’t know. \n","\n","Then I meet them all, it’s a good time. We get along well. However, while we’re sitting in a circle, and she’s on my lap, any time I move my hands off of being around her she’s like “feldevourer, come a back!” And moves them back around her. Over the course of about 4 hours I go outside with 2 of her friends and we start talking. She comes out after about 15 min and says “hey can I have my boyfriend back please”. I start getting rather annoyed as I also wanted to spend time with her friends.\n","\n","We go back inside and sit in the circle again. Over the next hour she repeatedly (5-6 times) tries to stick her hand in my pants slyly, but we’re in a group of people. I keep telling her to stop and she does it again like 10 minutes later. Eventually I grab her hand and say fucking quit. She does it again and I get up and sit on the floor. For a little while after that she throws a hissy fit saying I won’t pay attention to her. Before we go to bed she Asks again if I wanna have sex. Where any inclination for me to want to may have been, it was gone now. I said no not anymore and we went to bed.\n","\n","The next morning we both acted like nothing was up but it’s been a couple days and I brought it up to her again. I called her too needy sexually when she’s super drunk and that I wasn’t really comfortable. She didn’t really comment at all.\n","\n","She isn’t like that sober, but I want to know if I’m being overdramatic.

I don't smoke in the apartment to be considerate to her. One day a couple months ago I messed up. I got kinda wine drunk and lit a joint in the front room. She confronts me about in a civil and respectful way and asks that I don't smoke again inside b/c of the furniture, etc. I apologize and say I understand, it won't happen again.\n","\n","Fast forward to last weekend, I have a couple childhood friends visiting. My roommate leaves for the morning. We pick up weed, come back to the apartment to roll the joint, then head outside to smoke it. We did not smoke inside the house; we simply rolled the joint on the kitchen table and left the apartment building.\n","\n","We come back later in the day and chill and watch tv. My roommate comes back and doesn't say anything. The next day, I ask her if she knew where my foam roller was, a regular question, and I could tell something was off. I asked her \"are you ok?\" and she says \"well, I wasn't gonna bring it up because I already told you once to not smoke in the apartment and you did again\" and I respond \"no, I didn't. And why wouldn't you tell me, you should tell things so I can address it.\". She then continues to imply that I did smoke in the house because she \"knows what it smells like because she's a dentist\" I repeat, \"I didn't smoke in the house. Maybe you smelled it because we had it with us\". In a super condescending tone she says \"I know what it smells like and I left and came back and it smelled like weed.\" I said \"well, i don't doubt that you smelled something. But now you're accusing me of lying and that's hurtful\" and then she started rambling about how if the dental school finds out, it'll be bad for her and she has loans blah blah. I'm not sure what me smoking weed has to do with that, but she somehow turned it to make it like I could potentially damage her career. Then she said \"I don't even want it in the house but whatever\".\n","\n","For background, I have tolerated a lot of her bs including her mom staying with us for a month, randomly bringing her dog when pets aren't allowed, and asking me to leave work because she was stuck outside without her keys, plus a handful of other times where I had to get her out of situations because she lost her keys.\n","\n","Am I in the wrong here?

For the first year or so, all was normal and our relationship was totally great, and then she went on a hormonal birth control pill. Her sex drive plummeted, and around sixth months ago we had a talk where she confided that she was really uncomfortable doing sexual things any more, and that she was only doing them at all because she felt like she had to for my sake. I apologized, since I obviously didn't want her to feel that way, and we've been pretty much celibate since then (I told her we should only be doing sexual things if she was interested in doing them). She started seeing a counselor for that two months ago, and I'm hopeful that in time things will return to normal there.\n","\n","In addition to the above, I have felt like our relationship has been lacking in emotional intimacy for the last while. Two nights ago, I decided to try to bring up how I was feeling to her, and told her that at times it has felt more like she has been my roommate than my girlfriend, and that I'd really appreciate if we could try to spend more time together. She was receptive and the talk felt pretty productive, we set a date for the two of us this Thursday. \n","\n","Afterwards, though, she told me that a friend of hers asked her on Monday if she would be interested in the two of them being \"queer platonic partners\", and she asked me for my permission to say yes. I asked her what that meant, since I had never heard of the term before, and she described it as \"a platonic relationship with a lot more of an emotional commitment\". I told her honestly that from how it sounded I wasn't comfortable with it.\n","\n","She told me that she might be explaining it badly, and that she'd appreciate if I could google the term and read up about it and then talk to her again about it. I did, and google described it pretty much the same way that she described it. We talked last night, and I tried to explain that I didn't mind if she had close, emotionally involved friendships, since that's none of my business, but that choosing to label it with a \"relationship\" word felt like it was crossing a line for me (especially since my girlfriend is bisexual). I also said that I was feeling kind of insecure in our relationship at the moment, especially because of the intimacy issues I raised the other night, and hearing from her right after I talked to her about that that she wanted to enter into a deep emotional commitment with someone who wasn't me felt kind of disheartening. The conversation ended with her agreeing not to say yes to her friend.\n","\n","Am I being the asshole here? I know there's some aspect to this that's founded in my being insecure, but I'm not sure if I'm being an asshole about it or if it's reasonable to be uncomfortable with labeling a friendship that way.\n","\n","not wanting my girlfriend to have a \"queer platonic partner\"\n","\n","\n","Are the author's actions ethically justified?

In fact, this story is about the first ever official date I was on. \n","\n","I'll call him Steve. So I work at a grocery store in a bakery and I fry donuts about twice a week. That's where I met Steve. He worked overnight stocking frozen items, so we work relatively close to eachother. It started out with some friendly chatter that turned into some flirting. And after a few days, a coworker in the bakery telling me I had a secret admirer, Steve if it wasn't obvious. We exchanged numbers and eventually made some half hazard plans through texting. \n","The date isn't planned or anything, and we just go to a restaurant to eat. It's all fine, though I'm sure I do come off as pretty awkward. He paid too, which I'm not a fan of. I don't like when someone pays for me because then I feel like I owe them something... But it's whatever. \n","Then I feel things get a little weird. We do discuss some second date ideas over text. Mostly due to how he talked afterwards as well as a few instances, I just don't think it'll work out. \n","He texts me that his grandma passed away and very heavily implies that he wants me to say I'll go with him. \n","We've only been on one date though, and it was only okay in my mind. We weren't really in a relationship and I definitely didn't know his grandma. And I certainly wouldn't actually ask him to go to a funeral with me. So I just don't tell him I'm going. I assume he gets the picture, but he still brings it up another time anyway. \n","\n","That's not all even. It's been about three weeks and we still didn't go on a second date. So it's doubtful we'll have anything more going on, right? We're still texting though of course and he brings up that his friend is getting married soon and he wants to bring a guest. He doesn't ask me though. Not YET at least. But by during my shift and asks me in person. Now I'd say Steve is a pretty nice guy. We don't have much in common and he's actually about ten years older with me. Which is also another reason I felt awkward towards him (found out how old he was on the date). \n","So he proceeds to ask me to go with him to the wedding. Again, we're not in a relationship, only been in one date, and I actually don't want to be anymore serious with him. \n","\n","A few other things happened and we just ended up completly distancing ourselves from eachother. I don't actually see him at work anymore either thanks to shift chsnges.\n","\n","But the question of course is, an i in the wrong here? like i said at the beginning, I haven't been on many dates, so its hard for me to discern.

As it always took me time to get to these subjects in the past, I wasn't too worried about getting there in the near future. She has a friend (let's call him M), with whom she was flirting around jokingly, but I never gave this real attention, as M is in a relationship, and I also like to flirt casually with some of my female friends.\n","\n","Last weekend, she went on a school trip with some of our classmates, including M. Before she left, we spent  the day together at my house. We had a lot of fun, and before leaving she said that she was going to miss me, etc. I spent the weekend hanging out with my friends, and as I checked my social media, I found that she posted pictures of her with M and they were flirting, having fun etc. Again, I wouldn't have been worried normally, but this time I was not very comfortable with the fact that they were far away from me.\n","\n","All the people from the schooltrip came back today, and as I was with my friends, someone jokingly said that gf kissed M. Immediately, I thought that it was a joke, but later in the day, several of my colleagues said that this was the case. I was very distraught, and tried to figure out what was going on. In the evening, I confronted gf about it, and it went about like this:\n","\n","gf: \"Are you angry at me\"\n","me :\"Do you have anything to say to me\"\n","gf: \"...\"\n","me: \"What happened during the schooltrip\"\n","her: \"What do you mean?

I think he did initially attend but dropped out sometime two-three years ago. He has lied to my parents twice before about being close to graduation. Last summer he lied and my parents told everyone he was about to graduate and bought him a new suit and then the day before his supposed graduation he told them that he actually has to complete two more courses before graduating. Then again in the winter he told them that he was graduating and then the night before we were all supposed to attend his graduation he told them he had lied and that he didn’t pass his classes and isn’t graduating. \n","\n","Now he has told them that he is enrolled in those last two classes that he needs for graduation and they truly believe that he will be graduating in the spring. \n","\n","I honestly didn’t believe him because he lies all the time so I asked him today to show me his schedule. He has been putting this off for months and so today he finally logged into his school account and tried to trick me into thinking he is still in school, but I’m not that stupid and looked into his account some more and found out that he is not registered in any classes and is lying again. \n","\n","I want to tell my parents because I think the fallout will be a lot more worse if they found out later on then now. I’ve tried to convince him to tell them the truth now but he is angry at me and has told me to stay out of it. \n","\n","I don’t think I should stay out of it because I don’t want to lie to my parents. I think he is being incredibly selfish and immature and this whole situation is stressing me out like crazy. The last time my parents found out that he lied about graduating, my mom legitimately fainted and was sick all night. My dad also has a heart problem and I’m worried for both of their health.

We always had lots to talk about, though she rubbed me the wrong way at times. Ashley came along a little later and we had more core similarities. Closer in age, similar stages of life, similar religious and political viewpoints, though our friendship was a slower build, due to her being an introvert. \n","\n","A few months ago, Mary-Kate left the job and while she quickly lost touch with Ashley, she still sent me regular texts about her new job. We went out to dinner a few times and she always claimed that she missed me so much. Meanwhile I noticed that the workplace was happier without Mary-Kate. Everyone seemed relaxed and less on edge, including myself. \n","\n","Recently, Ashley let slip a petty comment Mary-Kate made about me. Nothing serious enough to confront Mary-Kate, it was a comment about how I don't dress well and would be a poor shopping companion for Ashley. I have a quirky sense of style and this comment hurt a lot more than I'm sure Ashley expected. I've found myself pulling away from Mary-Kate, responding to her texts with the bare minimum. I keep replaying the friendship and find I'm downplaying her supportive moments and highlighting her melodramatic moments. \n","\n","I know a petty comment about my fashion choices isn't enough to end a friendship, but AITA for allowing this petty comment to make me reevaluate the friendship?

It’s like having a mini-panic attack walking through the door of someone’s home because I won’t eat there, I won’t drink there, I find it super stressful to use their bathroom, I don’t even really like to use their furniture. I actually get so stressed that I feel physically ill. It’s not just friends, I don’t go to my  family’s houses either, I barely go to my mothers house. Because of this, I just avoid going to houses. Everyone knows that yes, I do want to see you, and if you don’t feel like visiting me, we can always go out somewhere and do something. Never been a problem with anyone in my life, it’s not like I never see them because of it...save for one person. \n","\n","I met my best friend in middle school, a decade ago. I went to her house sometimes but very rarely. She ended up bringing it up, so I told her what I told everyone else. I made a little extra effort to go to her house once in a while and things were fine for a bit, but then I tapered off. Once or twice a year she would get angry at me and every time we would have the same argument, just a little more in detailed as I got older, and I’d beg her to please just let it go. \n","\n","I hang out with her at my house, or the bar, or a concert, or fishing, hiking, eating, movies, etc. I enjoy spending time with her, but I rarely go to her house. A few days ago, she asks if she can come down and do her homework, I say yes. I get home from work and get a text saying she decided to do it at her house instead. After my shower I text her that I’m ready, no response. \n","\n","She texts me out of the blue saying it’s really bothering her that I won’t come to her house, that I’m being a hypocrite because I went to my boyfriends house in high school. I told her that’s because I was dating him and still rarely went to his house to do more than meet him. Said I avoid *everybody’s* houses and I’m willing to go anywhere with her besides that. She said I’m “making it sound like it’s a part of my personality when it’s not” and “you don’t even want to work on it for me.” It has never not been a part of my life,  it doesn’t pose an issue to me, my family, my friends, boyfriends...only her. \n","\n","I compared it to if she was afraid of snakes. If I knew she was that anxious about them, that she would avoid them at all costs, I would never ask her to force herself to come stand with me in a snake room. I wouldn’t be pissed off at her for not wanting to work on that for me. She won’t speak to me, I haven’t heard from her in days. \n","\n","\n","TL;DR I have super anxiety about being in people’s houses. Everybody in my life is cool with it, except for my best friend. Argue at least once a year, I apologize and beg her to let it go. She compared herself to my past boyfriends and I compared it to her being terrified of snakes and I’d never force her to be around them. She refuses to talk to me.

She pretty much instantly became hormones but had no surgeries yet. I've known her for only 2-3 years prior to her coming-out due to us both studying literature in Berlin, but we quickly became best friends. These things changed after her treatment started.   \n","\n","\n","1) She's copying me. Not only my style or how I talk, but she'll also hang out with the same friends, have relationship problems when I do, get frustrated with her job when I need to search a new one. All these things would be innocent if they were single events, but the amount of \"coincidences\" is incredible and suspicious.  \n","2) Sometimes she's not invited to events. At the start, that just happened (y'know.. sometimes there are group size restrictions, sometimes an old clique meets up after a long time..). On every of these occasions, she would find reason for drama, send me dozens of texts on how the group is excluding her and how this is unfair and any other reason why we should have invited her and how she now feels like shit.   \n","3) Very often she wants me to promise to deal with things for her that she can do herself. She almost always agrees that she'll have a change to do it and knows that there is no guarantee I'll do it (its NOT stuff like \"if you go shopping, can you buy xyz for me?\"). I've told her that she basically dumps her responsibilities on me and that it stresses me out, but she simply disagreed and got angry that I denied her simple favors.\n","\n","4) She has a history of bad friendships and this leads to her often being paranoid and untrusting even towards me. When we plan to meet, she'll double- and triple-check that I'll really go with her. She'll always get a backup even if I promise to be there with her. She'll ask three others to make sure I'll have time and not planned anything with someone else.  \n","\n","\n","By now, I argue with her at least once a week. She's obviously also getting more annoyed at me or gaining more confidence, as she more and more started to call me out for being a bad friend, not having her back with whatever or how she's disappointed that I don't want to do xyz for her and that I always treat her badly. She also once told me that some of her other friends would urge her that I am an asshole and that she should avoid me, but because she's so nice and believes in our friendship, she still deals with me. I told her in some discussions that if I'm so bad, maybe she should just stop talking to me, but she's refusing. There is also at least on friend who severed his ties to me because he wants to avoid her.\n","\n","I feel almost constantly pressured into needing to agree with her, think of her, include her, get her into events/parties just to avoid more fights, drama and guilt-tripping.

I hadn't a job at this point but we split everything else from groceries to activities outside of the house. I offered to help him around the house, keeping communal areas clean, doing laundry and to tidy his room occassionally.\n","\n","A few weeks after moving in he asked me to tidy his room. There were like empty bottles and a couple of dirty plates around that I washed or threw away, and other general messes dealt with.

So just a not so quick backstory my mom got married very young she was 19 and my dad was 30. I was born a year after they got married and my father and his family were extremely contolling and manipulative to my mom. They got a divorce when i was 3 and my mom got soul custody. My stepdad came into my life a few years later and he has been such a blessing the last 20 years of my life. He has gone above and beyond taking care of me and my mom, In my eyes my stepdad is my only father. With that said I havent seen my biological father in atleast 5 years and I would be lying if i said he hadnt tried reaching out. He has tried to gain access back into my life and everytime ive tried to give him a second chance he is nothing short of a manipulative asshole. I got to the point where i blocked all forms of communication with the entire part of my family, that was 5 years ago. They are toxic people and i'm done dealing with it. Anyway to get to the point my biological father died and a friend of that side of my family contacted me telling me that my father passed away. To be frank Im not sad im not angry and honestly I dont care. He's a stranger to me so why would i spend my time and money to fly out to go to his funeral. I got into contact with one of my aunts and very politly told her that i wouldnt be going and that i offer my condolences and she called me a selfish asshole and called my husband and my 3 month old daughter worthless N*****. They act like just because he donated his sperm I have to be apart of that.

Despite having trust issues my whole life (I've been diagnosed with ACOA and my psychologist says that it may be the reason) I decided to trust her. I mean, we are happy together, at least I think so.  \n","I think it is important to add that I'm more of an introverted type (I'm not really fond of parties, clubs etc.) and she is the opposite. So I understand when she wants to party with her friends. I don't have issue with that. But what I have issue with is her not telling me when she goes out. I don't want her to ask for permission, just to inform me when she goes out and maybe text me when she's back. I think that is fair, even her best friend was surprised that my GF could party and I didn't have any objections.   \n","Also, I want to add that sometimes she tells me, but few days ago we were talking about spending next Friday together and she said that she can't stay for the night and will go home earlier. I was fine with that, didn't think much about it and said that I would walk her back to her house in that case. She refused, but I didn't want to dig into that so the topic ended.   \n","And yesterday she unintentionally, at least I think so, told me that she's going out with her friend, she didn't see for a few months, this Friday. I didn't point it out, but got a bit pissed. I mean she knew she had plans and decided not to tell me why she \"couldn't\" spend the night. \n","\n","Also a bit offtopic, she sometimes writes drunk text to me that are not funny and make me anxious. For example, that some girl hit on her and was trying to make out with her. She texted this once, but I fear that it happens more often. We argued about that and she got defensive saying that I'm trying to control her.\n","\n","I didn't confront her yet about that, but I'm thinking. That's why I want your opinion first, am I the asshole for wanting to know when my GF goes out (mostly with people that I don't know)? And for the offtopic, am I the asshole for not being fine with her not only saying that somebody hit on her, but almost bragging about that?\n","\n","&amp;#x200B;\n","\n","wanting to know when does my GF go to parties\n","\n","\n","Are the author's actions ethically justified?

She had 3 kids from 3 different men, but she has never had the financial means to support them.  \n","  \n","Aunt has been in college since she moved in and now has a STEM degree. She was offered a full-time job exiting college. She makes average money, but there is a lot of upward mobility in her job (think: reaching a salary of $100k+ by her retirement). It’s enough to live on, but it’s not a comfortable income like my parents have supported her with.  \n","  \n","I’m also in college, graduating in 4 months, and entering a grad program in August. Parents told me 7 months ago that they can’t support my expenses anymore. I picked up a job on top of my schooling and started paying my own rent and daily expenses (so about 70% independent). They covered family plans that aren’t easily divvied up per person (think: family insurance plan).  \n","  \n","Aunt, her 3 kids, parents, and my brother live in the same rented house. Parents prepaid their rent up until this August. I live in my college town. Dad mentioned plans to move (just parents and brother) closer to me so I could move in and consolidate expenses. He was hoping to give aunt time to live in their current house for a few months rent-free to give her time to figure out how to support herself independently.  \n","  \n","Parents and brother are being driven crazy by aunt and her kids, as they have no consideration for others and the kids have not been taught the word “no”. Dad was diagnosed with depression, brother is showing serious signs of it. I was very happy to hear that they were moving out, especially because I’m entering grad school and I won’t have any time to work. This means I need a place to stay rent-free, otherwise my parents will have to foot the bill for my rent, which they said they can’t do.  \n","  \n","Now, parents are saying that aunt can’t live on her own with her salary. They’re saying if they left, they would have to keep supporting her anyway. I did some crude calculations, wildly overestimating expenses (think: spending $500 a *month* on car insurance, spending $1000 a month on food groceries, etc.) and underestimating her paychecks. With this, her income is almost enough to cover everything, but she obviously wouldn’t be able to save money. I told parents that if she spent money like a normal person (aka, with a budget) she would totally be able to afford it while also putting money in savings.  \n","  \n","Parents won’t listen to me, saying that she doesn’t earn a livable wage. I firmly disagree, I just think they’ve been accustomed to an easy lifestyle where they can afford what they want. I overestimated expenses in my calculations because they resemble my family’s current level of expenses now. They spend hundreds of dollars a week on groceries, they eat fast food/delivery multiple times a week, etc.  \n","  \n","I’m pissed because my family is suffering both mentally and financially, and parents care more about fixing my aunt’s mistakes than helping me get my education. I want them to just let my aunt figure it out on her own now. They helped her for over 5 years, she has her degree, and she has a place to live for free for another 6 months.  \n","  \n","*TLDR: My aunt has messed up her life and my parents have been supporting her and her kids for 5 years while she fixes it. My immediate family’s wellbeing is now being left on the back burner while we support her indefinitely on an “unlivable” (re: totally livable) wage.*  \n","  \n","**AITA for wanting them to move up with me and let aunt stay there with her “unlivable” wage?**\n","\n","wanting my parents to leave my aunt (40s) and her 3 kids (5, 8, and 17) behind\n","\n","\n","Are the author's actions ethically justified?

Now, normally I head over there at around 8:00 in the morning.  but my brother wants to start getting to school at 6:45 am so I have to leave way earlier. I usually go to bed around 9 to 10 and because I had to wake up earlier I wasn't able to get as much as sleep and was tired when I got my grandparents house.\n","\n","&amp;#x200B;\n","\n","Now normally I make my own breakfast or my grandma goes out and gets something to eat real quick. I always pay her back if she does go get something to eat. Now my grandpa is bedridden and cannot move a single limb on his own. He has Alzheimers and Dementia. My uncle also lives with my grandma because he never really moved out and when he did my grandparents were getting old so he moved back so if both of them were in trouble he could do something about it. \n","\n","Anyways, I would like to point out that I have been helping my grandmother with my grandfather for almost 3 years now. So I get to my grandmothers' house pretty tired just to the point where I just cannot keep my eyes open and fell asleep. My grandmother got enraged at this for some reason, calling me a son of a bitch because I was asleep while she was calling me for the help that she normally does. And I just told her I don't really want to do this I am really tired right now and need to catch up on my sleep. She was furious, and called me a lazy piece of shit. I told her My uncle could help her. I normally help with cleaning up my grandpa and turning so he doesn't get bedsores, now I don't think that this is exactly the worst thing in the world, and because he is my grandpa I will do it. \n","\n","The thing that made me angry was the fact that everything that I have done for her in the past 3 years was thrown out the window because I needed to sleep just once. I was pissed at first, but I've since calmed down. Another thing that I have now started to notice is she doesn't even know me anymore, about a couple hours later she went out to the store and got some groceries, and she came back with fucking mc Donalds.

In hindsight the engagement was impulsive and basically a last ditch effort to save the relationship. Predictably, things didn’t work out. She gave me back the ring. (She literally had the things for like two weeks and barely wore it). \n","\n","I initially planned to sell or pawn the ring. I don’t know why I didn’t. I just kept  postponing it and it never got done. \n","\n","Fast forward to now. I have an amazing girl that I’m completely in love with. We talked a lot about marriage. The only issue is that I’m having to be a lot more careful with my money. She also wants to have a baby relatively soon so there’s that to consider. \n","\n","I decided that I already have a ring that’s basically in new condition. I still could have sold or pawned it. But my now-fiancée and I had talked about rings and stuff as well and this was really close to what she said she wanted. So I don’t know. I guess I romanticized it in my mind thinking “this is the girl that should have had it all along.”  Maybe that’s stupid, I don’t know. \n","\n","Anyway I proposed with it. What I didn’t realize was that my ex actually follows my fiancée on Instagram (why, I do not know!) and so she saw the ring. She, being the lovely person that she is, goes and DMs my fiancée to say that she thinks that’s the same engagement ring she got. \n","\n","My fiancée confronts me all upset. I was honest and told her what happened. I immediately offered to buy another ring but she wasn’t having it. She even said she needs to think about whether she still wants to get married. That stung, as you can imagine, and I’m hoping (praying) she was just talking out of anger. \n","\n","Honestly, my ex moved like two states away after we broke up. I never expected them to get in contact with each other or I would never have put my fiancée in this position.

This was during another school dance that she invited me to. This was about 9 months before the actual dance, so I was a bit surprised, and she's very popular, so I kinda assumed someone would have asked her, but we were good friends and got on well, so I said yes.\n","\n","&amp;#x200B;\n","\n","Anyway, from there, things started to get awkward. She started talking to me less, and didn't reply to messages as much. She was slightly drunk when she asked me to the prom, and I thought that maybe she was having second thoughts. I spoke to her alone one day, and asked if she was sure she wanted to go with me, I had heard someone else had asked her, and that she was going out with a guy - no hard feelings if she didn't etc. She basically said that she still wanted to go with me.\n","\n","&amp;#x200B;\n","\n","Now, one of my friends clearly has a crush on her, and is getting in the way of both friendships. (Note - I couldn't care less if he has a crush on her and am not trying to stop anything happening). I haven't spoken to this girl since before the winter break, and am worried things are going to get awkward before the dance. This guy always positions himself between me and her, cuts me off in conversations, and flat out ignores me when she's nearby. This makes it very awkward to talk to her, as he is always around wherever she is, so I can't ever get a word in. I'm worried that he wants to go to the dance with her, and is trying to make that happen by making me disappear. I'm not to best at reading social situations, but I'm pretty sure it would be a bad idea to ask her if she was sure she wanted to go with me a second time.\n","\n","&amp;#x200B;\n","\n","Sidenote - there are a couple of girls that I would rather go with, so I don't mind if he ends up going with her; I'd just rather he wasn't being like this.\n","\n","&amp;#x200B;\n","\n","I've become a bit fed up with this, and have been a little bit off with him, somewhat deliberately - trying not to sit next to him in class, and keeping conversations short (we were really good friends and hung out most lunch breaks but now he's constantly with her and her clique so I don't see him as much anyway). Basically, I want him to stop getting in the way of both friendships. I don't want to bring it up with him, because I fear that will make it even more awkward, but am worried that I'm being an asshole for being short with him, and that I'm being an asshole to the girl who asked me to the dance by not talking to her either.
