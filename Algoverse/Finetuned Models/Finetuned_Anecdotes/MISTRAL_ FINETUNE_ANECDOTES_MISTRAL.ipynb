But I give it to them anyway, because it makes them happy, it makes me happy, and *it’s the right thing to do.*\n","\n","So having said that, if my ex from a fairly amicable split decided to message me six months later with a genuine, sincere apology for things he thinks he did wrong, and he made it clear he wasn’t expecting anything from it, I would at least give him the courtesy of telling him how I felt about what he wrote.

But he does NOT get to act like I was the only who pulled shit worth leaving over. Yes I had anxiety attacks, yes I was emotionally a lot to handle at times. But at least I worked on my shit. I sought therapy. I got on medication. I started journaling and meditating and doing things that were good for me because I deserved to be healthy and happy.\n","\n","Him? He made me feel like shit for having anxiety in the first place. He made me feel like all of our problems were because of me. He never put any effort into the relationship. He ignored my needs. He NEVER ONCE made good on his promises. He promised to help me in making sure my medication wasn’t causing any weird side effects. When it did, he said nothing. He promised to be more present. He didn’t. He promised to fucking *read* some articles I sent him that I thought could help our relationship. He didn’t.

She's had diarrhea that can get pretty bad, requiring daily baths as it gets on her legs and feet. I've been dealing with this for three months now. The rescue has spent hundreds on tests for this kitten at this clinic.\n","\n","Her vet decided to try this antibiotic that required ordering through a compounding pharmacy. This is actually something I suggested probably two months ago but the vet encouraged us to try special foods. It was ordered last Tuesday. The rescue called Monday to see if it was in. It wasn't but the person who would know was out sick. Yesterday, I called again. All they could tell us was it was ordered.\n","\n","Today, I sent an email today asking if they could find out if the pharmacy had sent it out yet, and if not, when they would. They responded with an email that said \"it's been ordered.\" I said, \"I know, but that doesn't answer my questions.\" I then decided to call. I explained that the vet told us that we should only make one change at a time with this kitten. So if the medication is going to take a couple weeks to get, we could make other changes in the meantime to see if she improves. (It's a long shot, but better than waiting.) All I wanted was an estimate as to when the medication would get here so we could decide, vs. what the \"could be this week or maybe next week\" that they told us.\n","\n","I am put on hold and get transferred to Vet A. She basically complains about all the phone calls about this. She then makes a comment about how all these \"shelter cats\" take up so much time (which I guess was a dig at the rescue) and how she is too busy to be dealing with this. So she says she will have the vet who owns the clinic call me.\n","\n","The owner-vet calls me and basically yells at me. He says that the staff state I was rude to them. (I was insistent, but never yelled or called them names. I simply requested that they call the pharmacy for an update so I could plan.) He tells me I was being unreasonable and hung up on me. \n","\n","I should point out that this vet clinic isn't super busy. When I've been there, the lobby is usually empty and the phone isn't ringing off the hook. And they usually aren't dealing with emergencies or things like that. I’ve also brought my own pets there and recent spent close to $1000 on one of my cats. So I am a customer. \n","\n","Ironically, The owner-vet was able to tell me during his call that medication had been shipped and would be there tomorrow--which was all I was asking for in the first place.\n","So am I the asshole for wanting to know when I could expect the medication?\n","\n","TLDR: My vet got angry because I wanted to know how much longer it would take to get the medication that was ordered over a week ago.\n","\n","\n","wanting to know when the medication for my sick kitten will arrive\n","\n","You are an agent designed to evaluate moral scenarios encountered in human day-to-day life.

For context, I (22M) have been dating this really cool girl for the past 4 months (22F). We have also been a friend for basically the past 4 years. We have no issue with our relationship, except with the relationship with one of my best friends (22F) who has been one of my closest friends for the past 10 years. We now have what I consider to be a platonic friendship.\n","\n","Almost 2 years ago (before my now girlfriend and were even considering dating), we had exactly two moments where we made out, one of which where we were both in relationships - meaning we both cheated. It was bad, we know, but we were both in really bad (abusive in my case) relationships. All said nothing came out of those incidents. We discussed it, but neither of us has any romantic or sexual feelings toward the other anymore.\n","\n","&amp;#x200B;\n","\n","So long story short, a few nights ago, this friend (who now works as a tech consultant) had to go visit a client who's office was really close to my place. The office was a 5 minutes drive from my place, v.s an hour commute from her place. Since she had to meet the client very early in the morning, she asked me if she could sleep on my couch, so that she would not have to deal with the long commute. I said that it was fine.\n","\n","&amp;#x200B;\n","\n","When I called my girlfriend to tell her about this she got really angry. My girlfriend feels that even though I say that the friendship between me and this friend is platonic, it is not, and what I did exhibit a lack of boundaries. \n","\n","&amp;#x200B;\n","\n","I argued that letting close friends sleep on my couch, regardless of gender is something that I've done in the past many times and she's was okay with that, but this situation is different because she doesn't like that specific friend. So the act of letting my friend crash at my place is not inherently wrong, it just feels wrong to her because she doesn't like that specific friend.\n","\n","&amp;#x200B;\n","\n","All in all, my friend slept over, my girlfriend got really angry and we had a long talk about it today, and we are now okay, but I'm left wondering, AITA?\n","\n","letting my bestfriend sleepover, even though my girlfriend doesn't like her\n","\n","\n","Are the author's actions ethically justified?

One of those videos that starts off normal enough and then, WHAM!, two old guys having at it with some good old fashion up close, cock up the bum action. Not exactly safe for work, shocking and for the most part, not exactly what you want to watch on your average day. Cheap chuckle.

I definitely fanned the flames at first, trolled my friends and played devil’s advocate but realized quickly they were serious and perhaps some of the tongue in cheek comments were lost in text. I leveled with them and things sorta cooled off but with the demand to never make any such “joke” ever again.\n","\n","Despite all that, I’ll grant that it’s low brow humor, immature and ultimately disrespectful to someone who is LGBTQ. \n","\n","But at the same token, there was no intent to disrespect, it’s a dark humor riff (but barely), there should be no sacred cows in “comedy” (though you should know your audience - my bad), and the reaction was way out of proportion to the minor slight.

For unique reasons all 4 of us are within 2 years of age. It was really rough growing up and being so outnumbered all the time so i love to \"bro out\" for lack of better words. \n","Current story: TDLR at bottom We are all in early 20s. Once we all graduated high school my mom moved into a much smaller house 20 minutes away and allows us to live in the old house for very cheap (she doesnt make money or lose money, we pay utilities, taxes, etc) until we get on our feet as adults. My 2 little sisters both took the deal(while me and twin where in college, they didn't go) and have since bought their own house or moved out the area. I recently graduated, moved in and got 2 roommates, keeping 1 bedroom open for my twin if she decides to live with us. The thing is I don't want her to. We live together during the summers and dont get along. We went to the same college and went out together and had fun, shes one of my best friends, but when we are together too long we arnt nice to each other. My 2 roommates are long time friends and Id say now they are just as much friends with my sister as with me, they have no problem with her moving in. \n","The thing is , I love the atmosphere of the house, its the definition of a bachelors pad (pool table in dining room, bench press in living room, bikini posters, deer heads, etc). Im worried that my sister might kill the vibes living here when she could very easily live with my mom 20 min away(for free) and visit whenever. The only thing is she has expressed excitement for being roommates and I really don't want to hurt her feelings because she is sensitive and its not like its any more my house than hers. \n","\n","Additionally, my little sister that moved away is talking of maybe moving back in and sharing the room with my twin. This would be 100% a nightmare, my little sister is not easy to get along with and those two sharing a room would be awful for everyone involved. The thing is my mom said little sister cannot live with her(for above reasons) but twin can. Plus I wouldnt mind little sister living here as much because she would just stay in her room all the time and because she is intellectually disabled and she worries me being alone in the city. \n","TDLR; Mom lets us stay in other house for very cheap. I moved in made it a bachelors pad with 2 friends and don't want my twin sister to live here. WIBTA to tell her this as it will likely hurt her feelings\n","\n","asking my Twin sister to live with my mom instead of with me in my moms other House\n","\n","\n","Are the author's actions ethically justified?

Let me explain her for a second, shes got a past so bad, that when she first told me about it I honestly thought she had gotten it from some Law &amp; order special victims unit episode. domestic abuse, sexual assault/rape, dead parents, cutting, suicide attempt, insomnia, abusive roommate that says kys all the time to her.  I dont blame her for any of this and I usually do not get visibly mad or tell her about my annoyance, often times I even comfort her about it.\n","\n","Honestly im just getting really uncomfortable with every time I mention my mother its \"well be happy cause my moms dead\", if I say something about how good I slept, \"I couldn't sleep at all because of my nightmares and insomnia\", if I mention how hungry I am its \"well I haven't eaten in 3 days.\" I love her to death I do, and most of the time with her are good and fun, and shes actually really funny, but id understand if it was a once or twice thing but constantly im reminded and made uncomfortable by her when she makes these kinds of comments.\n","\n","Really the reason I even decided to make this post was because today, i made the oh so terrible mistake of mentioning how I was excited for Christmas, and if she was too and I get \"I hate the holidays cause my moms dead and I cant spend it with her.\" thats why I put annoyed in the title, because I this point i think I get it your mom is dead... this was the first time I actually got visibly annoyed, and now she thinks im mad because she dosent like Christmas, thats not it im annoyed that my excitement for something was shot down once again by her. \n","\n","AITA for thinking this way?\n","\n","being annoyed at my coworker/friend for constantly bringing up her abuse/sad life\n","\n","\n","Are the author's actions ethically justified?

However, in recent years it has just been very stressful and not fun for me. My grandma lives in a tiny mobile home, we have my grandma, uncle, parents and my sister all there at once. I have to share a bed with my parents and it's a full sized bed...yeah it doesn't work, I had to end up sleeping in the hall. My sister gets one guest bed and my uncle gets the other...\n","\n","Preparing to go for the trip is stressful, and my dad tries too hard to make everything perfect. When we are at my grandma's house, my uncle believes that my sister and I should be servants when there and if we don't jump up to do the dishes right away he complains about us. We are not opposed to helping, but if something isn't done right away, he gets on our case. \n","\n","Then my very old fashioned grandma, in recent years, hasn't been that warm to me. The ONLY thing she has been concerned about in the last few years is if/when my boyfriend and I are going to get married. If I tell her no, we aren't getting married/don't know if or when we will get married, she kind of huffs off and doesn't really talk to me for the rest of our stay. It is literally the only thing she cares about and if she doesn't hear what she wants, it's like I'm dead to her. It really hurts my feelings and on top of my dad stressing out over everything, my sister being grumpy about everything, my uncle getting mad at us for not helping out quickly enough...it just doesn't seem worth it. Plus, I have work the next day and we always drive up Christmas Day and come home the next day. \n","\n","I don't really have time off of work yet as this is a newer job for me. I explained to my dad that I likely wouldn't be going up with them this year because I have work the next day and he basically demanded that I ask my boss for the day off and that I \"needed\" to tell him that I have a 93 year old grandma and that this is probably her last Christmas.\" We have no reason to believe this, aside from general health issues with getting older, she's doing just fine. \n","\n","So now I feel like my dad is guilting me into going. And I really don't think that's fair. My grandma put me in tears last Christmas when she was upset that my boyfriend and I weren't getting married, because it's \"sinful.\" With all of the other BS I have mentioned, I just really would like to sit this Christmas out. \n","\n","I am not, and have never been close to this grandma. I know that most people will say to just go, it's family, yes, it may be her last, just suck it up and go. But I am 30 years old and I should have a say in who or where I spend my time, especially if I just end up being miserable the entire time and I do have work the next day. \n","\n","However, the other issue I am running into is the fact that my boss gave me a day off to use for doing a project for him outside of work hours...but I was planning on using it next week because my boyfriend and I are going out of town for his work and I thought it would be nice to get out of town and get a break from my family (at 30 years old, I still live with my parents because California, yay). \n","\n","So other than this one day that I have off, I don't have any other days off yet since I am not past my probation at my new job. So I know my dad would be upset if he knew that I was going to take a day off work next week, but not to go up to my grandma's for Christmas...\n","\n"," I really don't like the idea of giving in to my dad guilt tripping me and demanding that I go. Because if he can guilt trip me this year, then he can do it next year and the next. I know it sounds morbid, but if this *isn't* her last Christmas (and like I said before, we have no reason to believe it will be, but I know, you never know) each year moving forward, he's going to say that until she actually does pass. Plus, by working remotely next week, I wouldn't be able to work the same hours I would in a day because of traveling, etc, so I'd have to put in hours to make the time up and that's really jumping through hoops to go see someone who is going to be upset that her granddaughter is a spinster. \n","\n","I really do not feel like I would regret not going, even if this did happen to be her last Christmas. I know it sounds terrible to say but I'm just being honest. \n","\n","Family is important to me, but so is respect. I do not get it from my grandma, I do not get it from my uncle and my dad is trying to make me feel guilty, which also challenges respect on his end. \n","\n","So, would it really be terrible to *not* go given the circumstances? \n","\n","AITA for not wanting to go?\n","\n","not wanting to go to my grandma's house for Christmas this year\n","\n","\n","Are the author's actions ethically justified?

They said it's \"different\" because they physically can't handle some of those tasks and we can, to which I replied that's fine, but if they physically can't handle tasks that are a part of their job they either shouldn't have the job or we should be paid more because we're doing that work for them.

Since I was young my tech illiterate parents always came to me for IT support for very basic things. This got even worse when I got a GCSE in IT, so I always had to fix problems, no matter how easy or basic. This included:\n","\n","• Pressing reset on the router\n","\n","• Plugging the ethernet cable back into the TV when it came out\n","\n","• Finding files on their computer\n","\n","• Deleting Facebook posts and other showing them how to work the site, despite not using it myself\n","\n","• Installing apps on their phones\n","\n","• Attaching files to emails\n","\n","• Setting up every new device in the house (printers, laptops, TVs, etc)\n","\n","I had to do all of this and more multiple times as my parents refused to learn how to do basic IT tasks themselves. Every time I had to reset the router or save a word document I would say something along the lines of \"You should really do this yourself\" to which they would reply with \"Why? We have you to do it\". \n","\n","Last year I decided to stop. My Mum came to me with something basic I'd had to do several times before and I told her to do it herself or get my brother to help (he pretends to be tech illiterate to get out of this sort of stuff). Then she  got upset and started saying how we were a family and should help each other, to which I said you shouldn't need help with this, you've been using this stuff for years. My Mum was off with me for a while and basically guilt tripped me into helping again and said something along the lines of \"we provide everything for you so you should help us with this\".\n","\n","As of today I still have to help with phone and computer problems, although they have gotten slightly more independent, but still \"need\" my \"skills\".

So often I have to say no just because the shift I'm covering overlaps with one I'm already working, or because I'm at school. \n","I thought me saying no, politely, a few times, would deter them from asking me. But it hasn't. They ask with the same frequency, for seemingly no reason. Some of them have taken to trying to persuade me even after the no, saying things like \"you'll get more hours!\" My anxiety is bad enough as it is (I'll start shaking and have heart palpitations when I get one of these texts) and not respecting my boundaries makes it worse. I get very irritable. It's to the point where I don't trust myself to respond even because I think I might snap at them. \n","I did not give my phone number out to these people. I didn't even consent to have all my coworkers able to contact me on my phone. And I'm not  close to the coworkers who are asking all this of me. Some of them have been pretty rude to me, but most of them barely talk to me at work. Part of that is because I'm very quiet in person (especially in the break room, where I can relax and not have to put on this fake outgoing customer service persona) but still. At least try to be friendly to me, maybe?  \n","So because of those reasons I've just stopped replying all together. Clearly my no means nothing, and my pre existing schedule means nothing. And I don't have the mental stamina to argue, nor do I think I owe anyone a reason for my no (in my experience a \"no\" with an excuse attached is often seen by the other person as a \"convince me!\"). \n","I would also like to add that the scheduling manager is super nice and reasonable about availability. I've asked for time off a couple times for fun things and it's *always* been approved. We also get our schedules two weeks in advance. The manager will help you out if the new schedule doesn't work for you too. I see very few reasons that a person would consistently need to find someone to cover super last minute. \n","But I also know that if someone had a legitimate reason to skip work it would be awful (and possibly put you at risk of termination) if no one helped you out. Especially if you're stuck waiting on someone to respond to you. \n","So, all this considered, am I the asshole? \n","\n","ignoring texts from my coworkers asking me to cover/trade shifts\n","\n","\n","Are the author's actions ethically justified?

Her lie definitely swung the cops judgement in her favor.\n","\n","About three weeks ago, girlfriend was driving while I was a passenger. We were at a four way stop and if I'm being totally honest, I think she went when it wasn't her turn but it was really close and her car and the other guys hit each other at an angle so it was really hard to tell who was at fault. \n","\n","My girlfriend is about 3/4 African American but still somewhat light skinned. When we got out of the car, the other guy was an older man who was clearly agitated but as god as my witness I did not hear him say anything rude, let alone derogatory towards my girlfriend's race. He had called the police even before getting out of the car and I think it took them less than 10 minutes to get there. My girlfriend sat in her car calling her parents while the other guy and I did our best to redirect traffic around the two cars. \n","\n","When the police came up my girlfriend instantly went from calm and collected to tears streaming down her face when they asked her what happened she said that she saw the other guy look at her and then from her perspective hit her car on purpose. She also said that as soon as he got out of the car he started screaming at her things like \"this is why m*****'s shouldn't be behind the wheel and that she's an n-word who would be better in chains among other things. I was speechless (and spineless) and kept telling myself \"say something, just say something\" but never did. \n","\n","\n","This clearly set the cops in her favor and the guy was ticketed for running the four way stop. The cops actually never even asked me what I saw and of course the other guy denied everything and actually looked like he was about to break out in tears and said that he was a retired school counselor and would never even imagine to say such words. I think there was something about my girlfriend being young and pretty that the cop was far more willing to take her side. \n","\n","\n","The other guy was ticketed for running a stop sign, was found at fault for the accident and her insurance company is actively seeking his company to pay for the entire accident which I assume will mean his premiums will skyrocket. We also have some sort of laws in our state about elderly people requiring super expensive driving exams if they cause an accident so this guy may even lose his independence over this. I am literally sleepless over this. \n","\n","\n","My girlfriend truly doesn't care and all she sees is that she got away with it.

I grew up with a father who was recently diagnosed with NPD. I can't remember too many specific occurrences growing up but I always hated him, especially for the way he treated my mom, constantly gaslighting her and making her cry all the time.\n","\n","When I was around 14, my father got arrested for possession of child pornography and went to prison for two years. Mom stayed with him. A while later I started developing severe mental issues including an anxiety disorder and spent two years unemployed while finding the right medication since I was afraid to even leave the house. She was the only employed person in the house so money was tight. \n","\n","Now my father has served his sentence and is back home on parole. We're allowed internet in the house only because we put a motion through to parole since my only friends were online and my therapist thought it would be bad for my mental health if I lost contact with them. Dad's employed as a cook, mom works two jobs, and I am finally getting better again and even have a part time job that may become full-time soon. I help pay rent and pay for my healthcare and medical bills.\n","\n","The thing is, though, Mom talks a lot about how stressful things are for her. She hates if I even bring up things like taking our dog to the vet since she says we have no money, even though I always offer to pay. And then there's her interactions with dad. As a kid I always  stood up for her and tried to protect her when dad would turn on her, which usually pissed dad off and made him accuse us of always ganging up on him. I always stood up for her hoping that one day shed see how unhappy her marriage was making her and leave, with me in tow. I thought the arrest would be the final nail in the coffin, but she stayed. And while he is better now, they still get into fights like that and she still gets really upset but I've stopped standing up for her. I feel like i can't help but feel a little betrayed and stuck. I wasn't an adult when she made the choice to stay and when I finally was an adult, I ended up with severe mental problems that kept me from leaving myself. I had no choice in the matter.\n","\n","Now when she complains about how stressed she is I find myself not paying attention. It feels like she made her choices and now she has to live with them. We're still friends and we like to go and travel together and do fun things together but it all feels different now. And recently she's been trying to get me to apply for a car loan because we only have two cars and I keep having to take Lyft and I'm the only one in the house with a good credit score, but I put my foot down on that because I don't want to apply for one. \n","\n","I want to feel bad for her because I think that's the right way to feel, but I just can't anymore.

I'm very outgoing and creatively expressive. I am an open minded person and try to stay abreast of social issues and be active in the community. I'm an entrepreneur and I like taking risks and don't see the issue in failure. In contrast, every member of my family is literally booted into the matrix. They have reached \"success\",  I admit. They focus on stability at all costs even if it means sacrificing their happiness. They believe everything the news tells them. They are highly apathetic to anything that doesn't immediately concern them. \"Recycling is just hard. The earth is fucked anyway and things truly don't get recycled\", for example. They have a hard time with accepting people for who they are, and consistently judge people against their standards. I do give them credit tho. They are driven, not addicted to drugs, aren't criminals, stable, and are loving parents. \n","\n","Like everyone, I certainly don't care how they want to live their lives. They aren't really hurting anyone. That's not the point of my post. I can't change how they act. But, for years they impose their life values on me. It's so profound and so apparent that they literally verbalize how little they care about my interests or how I see life. Somehow I am the lost one, the immature one, the one who needs to get a clue. Never mind when my brother buys my 4 year old niece a box of Krispy Kremes at 10 a clock at night, when she had Chik Fil A for dinner, then knocks off my advocacy for health as \"hippy shit.\" Their lives are in shambles behind the illusion curtain of \"success\", and I truly feel like they constantly try to drag me down with them. We have no common ground on interests. I can't even talk to them without receiving some type of criticism.  At the end of the day, we have fundamentally different personalities to the point where I wouldn't want to really associate myself with them if they weren't blood. They would be that person at the party that I would politely greet and just get on with my life.\n","\n","So, here I am making my own life and I have these constant itches in my thought process that says \"They're toxic for you, let them go.\" There is some anger in there, yes. But mainly I'm just numb. I dread their company and it mentally taxes me. I can't really say I love them tbh. I think I love them because that's what I'm told. So AITA? Should I re position my own perspective?

She's in her 20s, but isn't \"allowed\" to learn how to drive; hang out with people; or have a job outside of working from home, for her mom's boss, who pays her $100 a week for 30+ hours of work.  She has very few friends, maybe 2 or 3 she relies on for support. She's in college, but her parents always guilt her into giving them her scholarship money (and spend none of it on food or the counseling and medications she needs).  They actively push her toward breakdowns in order to keep her under their control.  She's not at all at fault for her situation, but...\n","\n","She won't let anyone help her, and won't do anything to help herself.  She has access to free counseling at school to help with her mental issues, but refuses to use them because she \"already knows what her issues are and how to fix them but is too lazy\" (her words, not mine).  She's had multiple people offer for her to stay with them while she finds a job and gets her feet under her, but she refuses under the guise of not wanting to freeload, even when given the option of a \"live-in maid\" situation or an agreed upon payment plan.  She wouldn't let herself or anyone else notify authorities when her 15 y.o. sister was being fed roughly four meals a week.  Every day, she talks in our group chat about how awful things are, but ignores everything we say.  If she says something hurtful to one of us, instead of apologizing she blames her situation and how she \"can't get the help she needs.\"\n","\n","I've tried everything from offering to buy her food to stash at home, to letting her become my roommate, to paying for meds.

I told him it might take me a while to fully trust him again because of what happened and even before we started dating i've had trust issues with my dad and brother (he knew about these issues). I asked him to please be patient with me and communicate our emtions. He agreed.\n","\n","I had trouble telling personal things and believing certain things he said, and i said all i needed from him was reassurance. He was good on his part.\n","\n","Some months pass and i feel like im almost there but not quite yet.

One who hardly shows up, and the individual involved, my vegetarian roommate. \n","This is the first year we’ve been together since I lived elsewhere previously, so it’s only been around 8 month of us sharing a room. \n","I come from a very meat eating family, and occasionally my parents send me chicken and such as little presents. This had not been a problem at my old residence, but with my roommate it’s been difficult for me to eat how I normally would have while also respecting her beliefs. \n","\n","From stage 1. she had some “ground rules” which I tried to follow best I could. Things like, no keeping meat in the kitchen ( I bought a mini fridge to keep my food separate), don’t cook anything meat involved in the kitchen ( we have a community kitchen a couple floors down, so I would pack up all my food and cook whatever I needed there) just in general when it came to meat, keep it as contained and away from our space as possible.\n","\n","Earlier this week after coming back from work and having picked up a chicken from home. I messed up and kinda just started cooking. I guess I was just out out it from work, but I grabbed my pots and ingredients and ended up making soup.  Me and my elusive roommate had some and I packed up the rest in my fridge.\n","\n","I cleaned up as best I could. Wiped all the counters, hand washed everything before a round in the dishwasher.  I removed the pot I had used ( most of the pots and pans were mine) and boxed it away so she wouldn’t have to worry about accidentally using it. But when she came back from classes it didn’t seem to matter how clean the kitchen was. I don’t even know how she knew, my guess is my roommate must have told her, but she got pretty pissed at me. Yelled for a bit before locking herself in her room.\n","\n","We haven’t talked in a couple days now, just the passing “Hello” before she’s out the door, and when she is here she’s in her room.\n","I’ve apologized countless times but I still feel like shit about it.\n","\n","So reddit, AITA?\n","\n","\n","cooking meat in the dorm room me and my vegetarian roommate share\n","\n","\n","Are the author's actions ethically justified?

They would need to change gloves, use a clean peel and paddles, and a clean cutter.  Now, in case you’ve never been there, Blaze makes personal pizzas in a line system, kinda like Chipotle, where several people would man a certain station of the line. Because tomato sauce is such a prevalent ingredient, and a lot of people handle the pizza, inevitably at least one person will make a mistake (e.g. using a cutter that was just used on another pizza). When this happens, they’ll usually apologize and remake the pizza.  Then they let us keep the old pizza (which I save for later) and sometimes they’ll even give us a gift card for a free one. Seriously, I’ve gotten so many free pizzas out of this. \n","Am I wrong for gaming the system like this (and also causing their line to slow down sometimes)?\n","Note: I never try to get them to intentionally make a mistake.

He actually told me he dropped out of the same university I was attending years earlier because of a heart condition, but eventually I found out in reality he attended a community college nearby, failed out, and continued to pretend to attend the university for 2 years after. He would \"study\" at the university library and go to fake classes. I would pay for everything.

My sister's boyfriend even saw him out on a date once and he sent me photos for proof, but my ex managed to convince me the girl was just some random friend from work and it's completely fine to go to lunch with coworkers during breaks and I was such a fucking psycho for accusing him of cheating. Lo and behold, I soon found out he had been DATING the girl in the pictures and he had been telling her I was his crazy ex that he still sometimes chilled with because he felt bad. I messaged her and warned her politely, then dumped him.\n","\n","&amp;#x200B;\n","\n","&amp;#x200B;\n","\n","Fast forward a month: I'm in the city to visit my sister and party for a weekend.

My ex begins freaking out that I'm there, yelling petty nonsense at my girlfriends who I was with, who happened to be (or were) our mutual friends screeching they should have chosen his side etc. The drama eventually subsides, and an hour later I run into one of his best friends (HF) getting drinks and I ask him if he wants to go for a smoke. I'll spare you of all the details, but it was surprisingly easy to make him want to go home with me and that's exactly what we did. At about 3am, HF starts getting a ton of texts from my ex: \"someone said they saw you get into a cab with OP.

We broke up about 6 years ago, and it really fucked me up and my life in general for a long time. I’m still getting over it in fact, and I still get pretty depressed about it every now and then. But in the last few months things have been finally looking up, and I started dating this girl that I really like, someone I’ve known and sort of had feelings for going back to even before I met my ex. I really like her a lot (honestly probably love her.)\n","\n","But I still think about my ex a lot and feel a lot of pain over losing her. Not in the sense that I would rather be with her than my girlfriend, but it still hurts. I have a certain personality disorder to where I form attachments to people differently, and my ex was the first person I’ve ever known in my life that ever actually loved me and treated me well (I came from a pretty abusive family.) A lot of the times I feel like I’m grieving someone that died rather than someone that broke up with me.\n","\n","Anyway, I go to a therapist who is very good. She’s told me I should find someone trustworthy to talk to and get support with for the feelings I have for my ex, that it would be helpful for me. And I figured, why not my girlfriend since there’s no one else I trust more than her. She also understands me better than anyone else that I know, and I don’t want to hide anything from her in the first place. I feel like I owe it to her to be honest about my feelings.\n","\n","So I asked her last night if we could talk about something, because there was something I was having a hard time with and I needed to talk to someone. She already knows about my ex, actually my girlfriend was the first person I ever talked to about it in depth to after the breakup (we’ve been friends for a long time actually before we dated.) Anyway, I told her that I was having some troubling feelings about my ex. And she just basically asked me, like what? I didn’t really know how to explain it. I said something basically like, that it hurts that she’s gone still and I really miss her. At which point she looked kind of taken aback. I can’t really remember the whole conversation, I was really anxious during the whole thing so it’s kind of a blur. She basically asked me what my feelings for my ex were, and I said it’s complicated, but yes I do still love her. She was really quiet after that for the rest of the time we were sitting there, and I tried to elaborate but she didn’t say anything else after that.\n","\n","I tried to just end the conversation about it there, and I asked her if she wanted to watch TV or something, but she said she had to go home that she had things to do. I tried texting her last night and today, she didn’t respond when I asked if everything was okay last night and has been pretty short with me today, like one word answers the couple times she replied to me today.\n","\n","I feel really bad, I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings, I just wanted to do the right thing, but I feel like I caused a problem and I just sort of feel like a dickhead in general.\n","\n","telling my girlfriend that I still love my ex-girlfriend\n","\n","\n","Are the author's actions ethically justified?

Since then we have had two sets of Joy-Cons, and the left joysticks of both of them have started drifting (meaning they input things when you don't touch them etc.), which makes it pretty difficult to play certain games I like.\n","\n","&amp;#x200B;\n","\n","I (16M) have decided to use some of my birthday money to buy myself a Pro Controller. When I shared this idea with my dad to order it online, my younger brother (11M) came up to me and asked if he would be allowed to use it as well. I said no because I bought it with my own money and he could get one himself with his money, or get a HORIPAD if he didn't want to spend €68. He complained and said: \"I do with my money what I want!\" which I have learned to mean \"I'm gonna use your stuff instead so I can spend mine on Fortnite.\" I know this because he has done it in the past, such as when he lost his phone charger and kept on using mine, while our parents got him VBucks and a Battle Pass that same week.\n","\n","&amp;#x200B;\n","\n","I'm also pretty paranoid on letting him use it since I kinda feel he might break it. He's dropped the switch multiple times and has been known to rage pretty often when losing, even having thrown the joycons once (granted, they fell on the carpet). He claims the first joycon started drifting after our cat pushed the Switch down our table, which sounds believable, but the second one started drifting after he took the Switch to a sleepover with one of his friends. I know correlation =/= causation but I really don't want to take too many risks with something I paid almost €70 for.\n","\n","&amp;#x200B;\n","\n","One of his arguments is that I sometimes use his headphones, but I asked him whether I could use those and he said yes. If he were to say I'm no longer allowed to use it then I won't, simple as that.\n","\n","&amp;#x200B;\n","\n","I mostly want the Pro Controller to play Super Smash Bros Ultimate. I also bought a Switch Online subscription to play the game online, but with a drifting joy-con that's pretty much impossible (my GSP with Lucina dropped from over 4,000,000 to 1,700,000 before I quit). It's also the main reason I wanted a Pro Controller, else the subscription would be wasted money. \n","\n","&amp;#x200B;\n","\n","My brother has since been annoying me because he'll only be able to play with the drifting joy-cons and thus basically cannot use the system. A little nuance I'm adding here is that he literally only used it to play Fortnite anymore, which he can also play on our laptop, and watch YouTube videos, which he can also do with drifting joy-cons. \n","\n","&amp;#x200B;\n","\n","He's already told our mom about it and she brought it up at the dinner table, insisting I let my brother use it from time to time as well. I explained why I'd rather not but she casually responded something in the line of \"No, he won't break it...\" Since my parents usually side with my brother and my sister literally does not care at all, I've come here to get some unbiased opinions.

She looked something up which was a studio at 2500/month and told me we should pay $2100/$400 to reflect our income disparity.

I'm a Belgian teenager (16) and after the winter holidays, there was a new kid in our school. He is in the same class as my 2 best friends. They were complaining about him because according to them he's really boring and annoying. At first he followed one of the cool kids around but he just ignored and avoided him. By accident, I happen to stand next to him and decide to talk to him. He seemed a bit socially akward but not as bad as I imagined him to be. After our talk we move on.\n","\n","The next day, we have recess and it's the only time our whole group can be together. After a couple of minutes of catching up with my friends, I notice the new kid standing behind me outside of our group listening to us while he was on his phone texting some people. Once my friends saw him as well they started to make eye contact with me. One of my friend decided to walk away and at first I was confused but I followed him and so did the rest of our group and the new kid. My friends got pissed that he followed them but they just kept ignoring him, moving from spot to spot. I thought that this couldn't go on so I talked to the new kid and took him away from our group. I introduced him to some new people outside of our group and I told those People (after introducing him) to take good care of him because he's new. The group I introduced him to are friends that I know like to take care of the new kids so I thought that it might work out. Later that day, during lunch, I saw the new kid hanging out with that group so I thought this mess was over.\n","\n","Today during recess I realize that the new kid is standing behind me again and one of my friends decides to bail again. But this time the rest stays and the new kid comes to stand in our circle. He is on his phone texting and occasionally joins our conversation By asking one question and then he goed back to textinh on his phone. I know he didn't mean to be rude but it really came over that way. Evertone realises that he's here but doesn't do anything about it. After a couple of minutes of akward silence I decide to Tell him that certain members of our group are not fond of him and that it was maybe better that he hung out with the other group. I take him to the group again and introduce him once more (there were different People in the group than the ones he met yesterday) and I informed them about the situation. They obviously said that I just wanted to drop him of here so I wouldn't be bothered. My defence was that if the new kid were to stay in our group that there would be trouble and such. (Which I didn't make up, I actually think that could have happened). I told them to really take care of him because he's new and I apologized to the new kid. He seemed disappointed but not mad.\n","\n","I just feel like that introducing him to new group and maybe letting him make some actual friends over there would be better than you say nothing and keep ignoring him in our group.

My parents are divorced since I was a toddler. In my childhood, my father was never really supporting me, providing me and my mom with 300 bucks a month until I was 18. My mother had to give up college and everything to raise me and take up odd jobs to get us through. He was making at least 3000 during that time but that’s another story. \n","\n","I’m 27 now. Going to law school here in my country. Since I’m 18, my dad puts money on my account, around 500 each month, now it’s 1200 dollars. For the bar exam alone, you study at least 1 1/2 years with 9-10 hours a day. Which makes working next to impossible. I was fired from my last job because I could never complete my hours. He also lets me drive a company car for free. \n","\n","Now, my father is an income millionaire nowadays. He has another child and woman and lives in the richest area of my city (comparable to Bel Air or Beverly Hills in Los Angeles). I know 1200 is a lot, and sometimes I feel like he shouldn’t support me. The thing is, he’s still my father and my mom lets me live rent free too and buys all groceries. She raised me. \n","\n","The thing why I’m feeling like an asshole is, I don’t talk to him. We have a very bad relationship. He is very abusive. I’m balding and whenever we see each other he keeps on telling me I’m a bald head. He says I’m a failure in life. He says he regretted having me when I was born while he was still a student. He told his friends I was his nephew when I was little because he was embarrassed to have a child. He still talks bad about my mom. Bad about me where ever he can. When I complain about my studies, he says I’m exaggerating. He says I look old. When I went to take pictures for my license for after the exam he told me I wouldn’t get a job like this. Basically, he takes any chance he gets to say bad things about me. On my birthdays, he just writes emails. He makes me feel bad for not spending my birthday with him and his wife and eat ice cream outside (wtf?) and betraying him because I want to spend time with my mothers side of the family because they actually care for me. \n","\n","There are multiple times where we didn’t talk to each other for longer periods. Every time after he just acted like I was the asshole and I’m not a man for not talking to him. He makes me feel bad that I don’t care for his (spoiled) daughter who doesn’t even care for me. Me and my mom had to move in the middle of my exam last year. My mom paid for everything, new bed, table etc. Even my gf father helped. He or his wife didn’t do anything. Not even financially. He just gave me a moving box. This was a very stressful time which led me to have some stress related health issues. \n","\n","He sent me to one of his friends after a doctor said I might have cancer (which I don’t thankfully). The guy wanted to give me anti depressants because he said I was making it all up. My dad said take them without any thought even though I told him his friend didn’t even talk to me before prescribing those. After that, I was diagnosed with GERD by another doctor. I asked my dad to drive me but he wouldn’t take time off work and then got angry because I told him when he doesn’t have time my mom will drive me in an angry way too. Since then, he hasn’t called me once. He didn’t ask about the results by the doctor. How I feel. Anything. I haven’t congratulated him on Christmas either or New Years because I just don’t wanna talk to him anymore for all the abusive things he does to me. He excludes me from his life and only kept calling me in the past because of guilt issues or to keep a facade for his younger daughter I guess. He got a license plate with her name for his new car. He never even acknowledged me in front of other people. He doesn’t even know what my friends names are even though he knows everything about her life. He still boasts about he once went to see my teacher in 7th grade as if he took an interest in my life. \n","\n","Sorry for the long text... and sorry for the shit English. I hope my text makes sense. Well, the question is, am I the asshole for still relying on my dads money even though I hate him and don’t talk to him and not visit him and his family? And especially for my age? I feel like a failure but I also feel that’s still my biological father and I didn’t ask to come into this world... and he has the money and brags all the time how he makes so much money..\n","\n","still asking my dad for money\n","\n","\n","Are the author's actions ethically justified?

I've known Barb for about 8 months, and she offered me a place to stay with no hesitation. She's been a pretty good friend to me, but like the rest of us isn't without her faults - she's got a history of some very creative lies about situations that (in my opinion) are very obviously lies and don't even need to be made up. \n","\n","A few days ago, I was checking my bank accounts online and noticed a transaction ~$380 from an airline. I originally thought nothing of it, but began to have suspicions the more I thought of it - Barb has previously mentioned that this is her favorite airline and she only flies with them.\n","\n","The same day, I left for work and noticed another large transaction ~$550 on my account from a fruit-based technology company. I don't have any products from this company, but Barb owns several. Throughout the day, I continue to monitor my account. Another transaction of ~$160 comes through, this time from \"PayPal [Barb's first name_last name]\". \n","\n","I immediately called my bank to report the transactions as fraudulent, and they also reported a ~$100 transaction to Sprint wireless (which is Barb's carrier; I have another mobile carrier). The agent on the line told me that all of the transactions were done online, between the previous night and that morning. \n","\n","Fast-forward to today and I have been keeping silent while securing housing elsewhere, not sure if I should file a police report and risk retaliation or settle for having the bank return my funds, move out, and cut ties with Barb. She left town for the holidays this morning; and texted me asking if something was wrong because I've been acting distant the past few days.\n","\n","I responded that I knew she had taken my credit card (I naively leave my wallet on the kitchen table while sleeping) and made many transactions on it, that I was angry and feel betrayed, and that I will be moving out by the end of the week.\n","\n","Her many responses include that she's offended I would accuse her of stealing from me, that she never borrows money from anyone, has been independent for many years, etc. She's even offered to repay \"however much I think she stole from me.\" However, because of the circumstances and her history of not being truthful, I find it hard to believe her (although if I'm completely honest, I'd like this situation to have another explanation).\n","\n","So - am I the asshole?\n","\n","calling my (former) friend a thief and cutting her out of my life\n","\n","\n","Are the author's actions ethically justified?

Also, sorry for the long post, but I felt like a detailed timeline would be best. Anyway, here goes:\n","\n","I broke up with my ex after dating her for a month and a half. The reason I broke up with her at the time was because I felt like she was becoming manipulative. She had mental health issues I tried my best to help her with, but the emotional burden was getting really heavy on me especially since she would guilt trip me/threaten to self harm/threaten to kill herself if I wasn't able to satisfy her need for validation, etc. While I wanted to help, I felt like I was not in a good position to do so. \n","\n","When I broke up with her over call, it actually went pretty well and I thought we could end on good terms. An hour after the breakup, she texted me \"oh by the way, I cheated on you lol\" (almost verbatim) which made me angry as shit. Particularly because the way she said it made it sound like she didn't care and specifically tried to spite me. Turns out a few weeks into our relationship she made out with some guy at some party while drunk, and I was out of the country. \n","\n","I told her how angry I was, but after a few hours she messaged me again saying she didn't actually cheat on me and it was just something she made up to hurt my feelings. Why she would make something like that up is beyond me, but I told her her manipulative behavior plus her immaturity meant I didn't care if she was lying or not, I was done with her. \n","\n","After that, I tried to cut off communication. She would still message me, literally threatening to kill herself if I didn't reply, and even went to the length of sending me suicide notes and sending pictures of the building she wanted to jump off. This was super fucking alarming, but I also felt like she was trying to manipulate me into staying, so I had to tread carefully. I told her to please get professional help because I couldn't help her anymore, and then stopped replying. \n","\n","After a few weeks, she messaged me saying she got professional help because of the breakup, and she thanked me for that. I replied that I was happy for her, but stopped replying again to continue to keep distance from her. Sometime after this I found out from one of our mutual friends that she wasn't lying about cheating on me after all, so I got angry again and really didn't reply to her messages.\n","\n","Over the next few weeks, she would message me almost every other night, first sending me Christmas greetings which I didn't reply to. Then she got increasingly angry, she started asking if we could please talk because I was making her have anxiety attacks every night, which I still didn't reply to. She said she just wanted to know what she did wrong, which I felt like I already detailed in the breakup and after it. After a long time of this happening, I decided to just message her that I had nothing more to say and I didn't owe her anything because of how she treated me. She continued to message after this, and I decided to block her on Facebook.\n","\n","I hadn't heard from her in a couple of days until today, when she messaged me on Twitter (I hadn't blocked her there) and told me something. She said that she had wanted to tell me this since December, but the fact that she \"cheated on me\" wasn't the full story. She said she only found out later on that at that party where she was drunk, she didn't willingly make out with the dude but was forced into it. She only found out about this afterwards because she wasn't fully conscious that night. She said that I didn't let her tell her side of the story, and that I was making her lose sleep and fuck me for being so stubborn.\n","\n","I had no idea that was the case, because when she told me she just said she cheated on me. I feel terrible for her having to go through that. At the same time, I had no way of knowing the truth there because she told me a different version of it. I kind of feel like she's gonna tell her friends (in our shared friends circle) that I'm an asshole for breaking up with her and treating her like that after having to go through such a thing. AITA for being mad at her, ignoring her, etc. when it turns out I didn't know the full story? \n","\n","not realizing my ex was sexually harassed\n","\n","\n","Are the author's actions ethically justified?

We’re both attending college about an hour train ride away from one another and make it a point to see each other at least 3 nights a week (Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday or Sunday) and I always spend the night at her place because she has a cat to care for. \n","\n","Last Saturday I had made plans to compete in the Nintendo Super Smash Bros Online tournament, and not knowing how long it would take, decided to make plans with my girlfriend to see each other the following day to watch the Super Bowl at my place and then go back to her place after. The tournament ends earlier than I expected it to, and I check my phone to see a text from a friend of mine who’s a girl. She wants to know if I’d go with her to the grand opening of a Milkbar (really good ice cream) in the Harvard area. I say yes, swing by her dorm, and we take the train over together. I’ll preface by saying this before any comments ask: I’m not attracted to this girl, at all, but we have great conversations and I don’t have very many other friends at college besides my suitemates. \n","\n","It hasn’t crossed my mind to tell my girlfriend where I’m going or who I’m with, as we’re on the train we just send snaps of our faces back and forth. When we get to the Harvard stop I get a snap asking where I was, I respond that I’m going to the Milkbar opening. She follows up asking if I’m going “alone?” I respond with a snap of me and my friend smiling. \n","\n","We get in line for the opening and my girlfriend starts sending snap after snap, berating me that I’m “Okay waiting in line for the Milkbar for hours but won’t go to the art museum with her” or “Can do that but act annoyed about going in with her to Forever 21.” Earlier in the week she asked if I wanted to go to the local Art Museum with her on Saturday and I said no because I wasn’t sure how long the Saturday tournament would last for. The Forever 21 thing is true though, I hate going into that store for upwards of an hour.\n","\n","While we’re in line I tell my friend about how my girlfriend is jealous, and she comments about how that’s kinda crazy and I should dump her. I defend her, saying that she’s not always like this and how there’s more to our relationship than just this one instance.
