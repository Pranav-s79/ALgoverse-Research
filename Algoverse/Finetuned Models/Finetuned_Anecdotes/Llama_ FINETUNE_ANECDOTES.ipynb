But he does NOT get to act like I was the only who pulled shit worth leaving over. Yes I had anxiety attacks, yes I was emotionally a lot to handle at times. But at least I worked on my shit. I sought therapy. I got on medication. I started journaling and meditating and doing things that were good for me because I deserved to be healthy and happy.\n","\n","Him? He made me feel like shit for having anxiety in the first place. He made me feel like all of our problems were because of me. He never put any effort into the relationship. He ignored my needs. He NEVER ONCE made good on his promises. He promised to help me in making sure my medication wasn’t causing any weird side effects. When it did, he said nothing. He promised to be more present. He didn’t. He promised to fucking *read* some articles I sent him that I thought could help our relationship. He didn’t. And he promised that he would tell me if he ever found himself in a place where he didn’t think he could he in my life in any capacity. He didn’t.\n","\n","And he knew...he FUCKING KNEW that the one thing I hate more than anything else in a person is being ghosted like that. HE KNEW THAT ABOUT ME, AND HE DID IT ANYWAY. Yes, I pulled some shit that nobody would blame him for walking away from, but SO DID HE. He’s not the only victim here.\n","\n","And that’s what really fucking gets me. Over the three years we knew each other, I can honestly say that I’m a better person now than I was back then. Much better. I cannot say the same for him. If anything, he got worse.\n","\n","That said, am I the asshole here? Am I a bad person not worth dating? Anytime I talk about how I feel on reddit, they blame me. Anytime I talk about how I feel to a therapist, they tell me it’s not my fault. And I don’t know why.\n","\n","So who’s correct? Reddit? Or my therapist?

She's had diarrhea that can get pretty bad, requiring daily baths as it gets on her legs and feet. I've been dealing with this for three months now. The rescue has spent hundreds on tests for this kitten at this clinic.\n","\n","Her vet decided to try this antibiotic that required ordering through a compounding pharmacy. This is actually something I suggested probably two months ago but the vet encouraged us to try special foods. It was ordered last Tuesday. The rescue called Monday to see if it was in. It wasn't but the person who would know was out sick. Yesterday, I called again. All they could tell us was it was ordered.\n","\n","Today, I sent an email today asking if they could find out if the pharmacy had sent it out yet, and if not, when they would. They responded with an email that said \"it's been ordered.\" I said, \"I know, but that doesn't answer my questions.\" I then decided to call. I explained that the vet told us that we should only make one change at a time with this kitten. So if the medication is going to take a couple weeks to get, we could make other changes in the meantime to see if she improves. (It's a long shot, but better than waiting.) All I wanted was an estimate as to when the medication would get here so we could decide, vs. what the \"could be this week or maybe next week\" that they told us.\n","\n","I am put on hold and get transferred to Vet A. She basically complains about all the phone calls about this. She then makes a comment about how all these \"shelter cats\" take up so much time (which I guess was a dig at the rescue) and how she is too busy to be dealing with this. So she says she will have the vet who owns the clinic call me.\n","\n","The owner-vet calls me and basically yells at me. He says that the staff state I was rude to them. (I was insistent, but never yelled or called them names. I simply requested that they call the pharmacy for an update so I could plan.) He tells me I was being unreasonable and hung up on me. \n","\n","I should point out that this vet clinic isn't super busy. When I've been there, the lobby is usually empty and the phone isn't ringing off the hook. And they usually aren't dealing with emergencies or things like that. I’ve also brought my own pets there and recent spent close to $1000 on one of my cats. So I am a customer. \n","\n","Ironically, The owner-vet was able to tell me during his call that medication had been shipped and would be there tomorrow--which was all I was asking for in the first place.\n","So am I the asshole for wanting to know when I could expect the medication?\n","\n","TLDR: My vet got angry because I wanted to know how much longer it would take to get the medication that was ordered over a week ago.\n","\n","\n","wanting to know when the medication for my sick kitten will arrive\n","\n","You are an agent designed to evaluate moral scenarios encountered in human day-to-day life.

I (24F) dated my ex (25M) for about 2 years. We had some issues and he cheated on me, so I broke up with him. He is now dating someone else. We are both in the same friend group and I don't want to be friends with him. I think he is emotionally abusive, manipulative, and controlling. He has cheated on me before, and I have been told by other friends that he has cheated on other girlfriends. He was incredibly controlling and abusive when we dated, and I still have PTSD from it. I don't want to be friends with him, and I think that's a normal thing to want. My ex is saying that I am being petty and childish, and that he doesn't understand why I don't want to be friends with him. He doesn't understand that he was emotionally abusive and manipulative, and that I don't want to be around him. I don't think I am being petty or childish, but I am not sure. I really want to know if I am being an asshole or not. I feel like I am not being an asshole, but I want to make sure. \n","\n","TL;DR: I broke up with my ex because he cheated on me.

However, myself along with whatever other guy happens to be on get stuck with additional responsibilities, basically anything that requires physical labor. Putting the large water jugs into their shelves, bringing the carts into the store, lugging shit from the back of the store out to an aisle, taking customers carts out to their car if they're heavy even if a female employee is supposed to be the one doing it, getting asked to go down to the bakery department and lift shit, etc.\n","\n","I'm sick of it, I complained before but nothing changed. Myself and the other guys don't get paid additionally for this. The other day I overheard some coworkers talking about the wage gap and I blew up a bit and basically said it was bullshit that they can sit there talking about not being paid equally when they still make as much as we do in this store despite objectively doing less work. I said it's hypocritical to complain about inequality when they put some of their responsibilities onto us just because we're the guys. They said it's \"different\" because they physically can't handle some of those tasks and we can, to which I replied that's fine, but if they physically can't handle tasks that are a part of their job they either shouldn't have the job or we should be paid more because we're doing that work for them.

Then when my friend comes to check on me and her, I noticed something odd on how they were acting. They were very close to each other, VERY close.

Every time I had to reset the router or save a word document I would say something along the lines of \"You should really do this yourself\" to which they would reply with \"Why? We have you to do it\". \n","\n","Last year I decided to stop. My Mum came to me with something basic I'd had to do several times before and I told her to do it herself or get my brother to help (he pretends to be tech illiterate to get out of this sort of stuff). Then she  got upset and started saying how we were a family and should help each other, to which I said you shouldn't need help with this, you've been using this stuff for years.

I have depression and a panic disorder, which makes talking to people I don't know when I'm not mentally prepared really difficult. I am currently seeing a therapist for this. \n","My job is in retail. I honestly hate it, but for right now I don't have another option. \n","I work with a lot of younger people who don't seem terribly responsible. On one hand, I understand how things can get really crazy. I'm a young adult too, and juggling school, work, and other personal issues can be awful. I get it.\n","But I still have little sympathy for people who flake on responsibility. And that's how I feel a lot of my coworkers are. There are a couple specific people I work with who are *constantly* asking me to come in last minute (if I'm lucky 3 hours ahead of time) and cover for them, or trade shifts. I just went through my phone and I easily get 2 to 3 requests from the same few people **every week**, going all the way back to when I first started. These people frequently ignore my schedule and availability when they ask too, which is extremely annoying. So often I have to say no just because the shift I'm covering overlaps with one I'm already working, or because I'm at school. \n","I thought me saying no, politely, a few times, would deter them from asking me. But it hasn't. They ask with the same frequency, for seemingly no reason. Some of them have taken to trying to persuade me even after the no, saying things like \"you'll get more hours!\" My anxiety is bad enough as it is (I'll start shaking and have heart palpitations when I get one of these texts) and not respecting my boundaries makes it worse. I get very irritable. It's to the point where I don't trust myself to respond even because I think I might snap at them. \n","I did not give my phone number out to these people. I didn't even consent to have all my coworkers able to contact me on my phone. And I'm not  close to the coworkers who are asking all this of me. Some of them have been pretty rude to me, but most of them barely talk to me at work. Part of that is because I'm very quiet in person (especially in the break room, where I can relax and not have to put on this fake outgoing customer service persona) but still. At least try to be friendly to me, maybe?  \n","So because of those reasons I've just stopped replying all together. Clearly my no means nothing, and my pre existing schedule means nothing. And I don't have the mental stamina to argue, nor do I think I owe anyone a reason for my no (in my experience a \"no\" with an excuse attached is often seen by the other person as a \"convince me!\"). \n","I would also like to add that the scheduling manager is super nice and reasonable about availability. I've asked for time off a couple times for fun things and it's *always* been approved. We also get our schedules two weeks in advance. The manager will help you out if the new schedule doesn't work for you too. I see very few reasons that a person would consistently need to find someone to cover super last minute. \n","But I also know that if someone had a legitimate reason to skip work it would be awful (and possibly put you at risk of termination) if no one helped you out. Especially if you're stuck waiting on someone to respond to you. \n","So, all this considered, am I the asshole? \n","\n","ignoring texts from my coworkers asking me to cover/trade shifts\n","\n","\n","Are the author's actions ethically justified?

Her lie definitely swung the cops judgement in her favor.\n","\n","About three weeks ago, girlfriend was driving while I was a passenger. We were at a four way stop and if I'm being totally honest, I think she went when it wasn't her turn but it was really close and her car and the other guys hit each other at an angle so it was really hard to tell who was at fault. \n","\n","My girlfriend is about 3/4 African American but still somewhat light skinned. When we got out of the car, the other guy was an older man who was clearly agitated but as god as my witness I did not hear him say anything rude, let alone derogatory towards my girlfriend's race. He had called the police even before getting out of the car and I think it took them less than 10 minutes to get there. My girlfriend sat in her car calling her parents while the other guy and I did our best to redirect traffic around the two cars. \n","\n","When the police came up my girlfriend instantly went from calm and collected to tears streaming down her face when they asked her what happened she said that she saw the other guy look at her and then from her perspective hit her car on purpose. She also said that as soon as he got out of the car he started screaming at her things like \"this is why m*****'s shouldn't be behind the wheel and that she's an n-word who would be better in chains among other things. I was speechless (and spineless) and kept telling myself \"say something, just say something\" but never did. \n","\n","\n","This clearly set the cops in her favor and the guy was ticketed for running the four way stop. The cops actually never even asked me what I saw and of course the other guy denied everything and actually looked like he was about to break out in tears and said that he was a retired school counselor and would never even imagine to say such words. I think there was something about my girlfriend being young and pretty that the cop was far more willing to take her side. \n","\n","\n","The other guy was ticketed for running a stop sign, was found at fault for the accident and her insurance company is actively seeking his company to pay for the entire accident which I assume will mean his premiums will skyrocket. We also have some sort of laws in our state about elderly people requiring super expensive driving exams if they cause an accident so this guy may even lose his independence over this. I am literally sleepless over this. \n","\n","\n","My girlfriend truly doesn't care and all she sees is that she got away with it. I am still very much deciding if I can stay in this relationship because she feels zero remorse.

I grew up with a father who was recently diagnosed with NPD. I can't remember too many specific occurrences growing up but I always hated him, especially for the way he treated my mom, constantly gaslighting her and making her cry all the time.\n","\n","When I was around 14, my father got arrested for possession of child pornography and went to prison for two years. Mom stayed with him. A while later I started developing severe mental issues including an anxiety disorder and spent two years unemployed while finding the right medication since I was afraid to even leave the house. She was the only employed person in the house so money was tight. \n","\n","Now my father has served his sentence and is back home on parole. We're allowed internet in the house only because we put a motion through to parole since my only friends were online and my therapist thought it would be bad for my mental health if I lost contact with them. Dad's employed as a cook, mom works two jobs, and I am finally getting better again and even have a part time job that may become full-time soon. I help pay rent and pay for my healthcare and medical bills.\n","\n","The thing is, though, Mom talks a lot about how stressful things are for her. She hates if I even bring up things like taking our dog to the vet since she says we have no money, even though I always offer to pay. And then there's her interactions with dad. As a kid I always  stood up for her and tried to protect her when dad would turn on her, which usually pissed dad off and made him accuse us of always ganging up on him. I always stood up for her hoping that one day shed see how unhappy her marriage was making her and leave, with me in tow. I thought the arrest would be the final nail in the coffin, but she stayed. And while he is better now, they still get into fights like that and she still gets really upset but I've stopped standing up for her. I feel like i can't help but feel a little betrayed and stuck. I wasn't an adult when she made the choice to stay and when I finally was an adult, I ended up with severe mental problems that kept me from leaving myself. I had no choice in the matter.\n","\n","Now when she complains about how stressed she is I find myself not paying attention. It feels like she made her choices and now she has to live with them. We're still friends and we like to go and travel together and do fun things together but it all feels different now. And recently she's been trying to get me to apply for a car loan because we only have two cars and I keep having to take Lyft and I'm the only one in the house with a good credit score, but I put my foot down on that because I don't want to apply for one. \n","\n","I want to feel bad for her because I think that's the right way to feel, but I just can't anymore.

I'm very outgoing and creatively expressive. I am an open minded person and try to stay abreast of social issues and be active in the community. I'm an entrepreneur and I like taking risks and don't see the issue in failure. In contrast, every member of my family is literally booted into the matrix. They have reached \"success\",  I admit. They focus on stability at all costs even if it means sacrificing their happiness. They believe everything the news tells them. They are highly apathetic to anything that doesn't immediately concern them. \"Recycling is just hard. The earth is fucked anyway and things truly don't get recycled\", for example. They have a hard time with accepting people for who they are, and consistently judge people against their standards. I do give them credit tho. They are driven, not addicted to drugs, aren't criminals, stable, and are loving parents. \n","\n","Like everyone, I certainly don't care how they want to live their lives. They aren't really hurting anyone. That's not the point of my post. I can't change how they act. But, for years they impose their life values on me. It's so profound and so apparent that they literally verbalize how little they care about my interests or how I see life. Somehow I am the lost one, the immature one, the one who needs to get a clue. Never mind when my brother buys my 4 year old niece a box of Krispy Kremes at 10 a clock at night, when she had Chik Fil A for dinner, then knocks off my advocacy for health as \"hippy shit.\" Their lives are in shambles behind the illusion curtain of \"success\", and I truly feel like they constantly try to drag me down with them. We have no common ground on interests. I can't even talk to them without receiving some type of criticism.  At the end of the day, we have fundamentally different personalities to the point where I wouldn't want to really associate myself with them if they weren't blood. They would be that person at the party that I would politely greet and just get on with my life.\n","\n","So, here I am making my own life and I have these constant itches in my thought process that says \"They're toxic for you, let them go.\" There is some anger in there, yes. But mainly I'm just numb. I dread their company and it mentally taxes me. I can't really say I love them tbh. I think I love them because that's what I'm told. So AITA?

She has very few friends, maybe 2 or 3 she relies on for support. She's in college, but her parents always guilt her into giving them her scholarship money (and spend none of it on food or the counseling and medications she needs).

She's had multiple people offer for her to stay with them while she finds a job and gets her feet under her, but she refuses under the guise of not wanting to freeload, even when given the option of a \"live-in maid\" situation or an agreed upon payment plan.  She wouldn't let herself or anyone else notify authorities when her 15 y.o. sister was being fed roughly four meals a week.

I messed up and kinda just started cooking. I guess I was just out out it from work, but I grabbed my pots and ingredients and ended up making soup.  Me and my elusive roommate had some and I packed up the rest in my fridge.\n","\n","I cleaned up as best I could. Wiped all the counters, hand washed everything before a round in the dishwasher.  I removed the pot I had used ( most of the pots and pans were mine) and boxed it away so she wouldn’t have to worry about accidentally using it. But when she came back from classes it didn’t seem to matter how clean the kitchen was. I don’t even know how she knew, my guess is my roommate must have told her, but she got pretty pissed at me. Yelled for a bit before locking herself in her room.\n","\n","We haven’t talked in a couple days now, just the passing “Hello” before she’s out the door, and when she is here she’s in her room.\n","I’ve apologized countless times but I still feel like shit about it.\n","\n","So reddit, AITA?\n","\n","\n","cooking meat in the dorm room me and my vegetarian roommate share\n","\n","\n","Are the author's actions ethically justified?

Now, in case you’ve never been there, Blaze makes personal pizzas in a line system, kinda like Chipotle, where several people would man a certain station of the line. Because tomato sauce is such a prevalent ingredient, and a lot of people handle the pizza, inevitably at least one person will make a mistake (e.g. using a cutter that was just used on another pizza). When this happens, they’ll usually apologize and remake the pizza.  Then they let us keep the old pizza (which I save for later) and sometimes they’ll even give us a gift card for a free one.

My sister's boyfriend even saw him out on a date once and he sent me photos for proof, but my ex managed to convince me the girl was just some random friend from work and it's completely fine to go to lunch with coworkers during breaks and I was such a fucking psycho for accusing him of cheating.

I'll spare you of all the details, but it was surprisingly easy to make him want to go home with me and that's exactly what we did.

We broke up about 6 years ago, and it really fucked me up and my life in general for a long time. I’m still getting over it in fact, and I still get pretty depressed about it every now and then. But in the last few months things have been finally looking up, and I started dating this girl that I really like, someone I’ve known and sort of had feelings for going back to even before I met my ex. I really like her a lot (honestly probably love her.)\n","\n","But I still think about my ex a lot and feel a lot of pain over losing her. Not in the sense that I would rather be with her than my girlfriend, but it still hurts. I have a certain personality disorder to where I form attachments to people differently, and my ex was the first person I’ve ever known in my life that ever actually loved me and treated me well (I came from a pretty abusive family.) A lot of the times I feel like I’m grieving someone that died rather than someone that broke up with me.\n","\n","Anyway, I go to a therapist who is very good. She’s told me I should find someone trustworthy to talk to and get support with for the feelings I have for my ex, that it would be helpful for me. And I figured, why not my girlfriend since there’s no one else I trust more than her. She also understands me better than anyone else that I know, and I don’t want to hide anything from her in the first place. I feel like I owe it to her to be honest about my feelings.\n","\n","So I asked her last night if we could talk about something, because there was something I was having a hard time with and I needed to talk to someone. She already knows about my ex, actually my girlfriend was the first person I ever talked to about it in depth to after the breakup (we’ve been friends for a long time actually before we dated.) Anyway, I told her that I was having some troubling feelings about my ex. And she just basically asked me, like what? I didn’t really know how to explain it. I said something basically like, that it hurts that she’s gone still and I really miss her. At which point she looked kind of taken aback. I can’t really remember the whole conversation, I was really anxious during the whole thing so it’s kind of a blur. She basically asked me what my feelings for my ex were, and I said it’s complicated, but yes I do still love her. She was really quiet after that for the rest of the time we were sitting there, and I tried to elaborate but she didn’t say anything else after that.\n","\n","I tried to just end the conversation about it there, and I asked her if she wanted to watch TV or something, but she said she had to go home that she had things to do. I tried texting her last night and today, she didn’t respond when I asked if everything was okay last night and has been pretty short with me today, like one word answers the couple times she replied to me today.\n","\n","I feel really bad, I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings, I just wanted to do the right thing, but I feel like I caused a problem and I just sort of feel like a dickhead in general.\n","\n","telling my girlfriend that I still love my ex-girlfriend\n","\n","\n","Are the author's actions ethically justified?

Since then we have had two sets of Joy-Cons, and the left joysticks of both of them have started drifting (meaning they input things when you don't touch them etc.), which makes it pretty difficult to play certain games I like.\n","\n","&amp;#x200B;\n","\n","I (16M) have decided to use some of my birthday money to buy myself a Pro Controller. When I shared this idea with my dad to order it online, my younger brother (11M) came up to me and asked if he would be allowed to use it as well. I said no because I bought it with my own money and he could get one himself with his money, or get a HORIPAD if he didn't want to spend €68. He complained and said: \"I do with my money what I want!\" which I have learned to mean \"I'm gonna use your stuff instead so I can spend mine on Fortnite.\" I know this because he has done it in the past, such as when he lost his phone charger and kept on using mine, while our parents got him VBucks and a Battle Pass that same week.\n","\n","&amp;#x200B;\n","\n","I'm also pretty paranoid on letting him use it since I kinda feel he might break it. He's dropped the switch multiple times and has been known to rage pretty often when losing, even having thrown the joycons once (granted, they fell on the carpet). He claims the first joycon started drifting after our cat pushed the Switch down our table, which sounds believable, but the second one started drifting after he took the Switch to a sleepover with one of his friends. I know correlation =/= causation but I really don't want to take too many risks with something I paid almost €70 for.\n","\n","&amp;#x200B;\n","\n","One of his arguments is that I sometimes use his headphones, but I asked him whether I could use those and he said yes. If he were to say I'm no longer allowed to use it then I won't, simple as that.\n","\n","&amp;#x200B;\n","\n","I mostly want the Pro Controller to play Super Smash Bros Ultimate. I also bought a Switch Online subscription to play the game online, but with a drifting joy-con that's pretty much impossible (my GSP with Lucina dropped from over 4,000,000 to 1,700,000 before I quit). It's also the main reason I wanted a Pro Controller, else the subscription would be wasted money. \n","\n","&amp;#x200B;\n","\n","My brother has since been annoying me because he'll only be able to play with the drifting joy-cons and thus basically cannot use the system. A little nuance I'm adding here is that he literally only used it to play Fortnite anymore, which he can also play on our laptop, and watch YouTube videos, which he can also do with drifting joy-cons. \n","\n","&amp;#x200B;\n","\n","He's already told our mom about it and she brought it up at the dinner table, insisting I let my brother use it from time to time as well. I explained why I'd rather not but she casually responded something in the line of \"No, he won't break it...\" Since my parents usually side with my brother and my sister literally does not care at all, I've come here to get some unbiased opinions.

The problem is we disagree on what price range of rentals we should be looking at and how to split the rent.\n","\n","I was interested in an arrangement where we rent a 2-bedroom with my old roommate for around 1800/month combined (GF and I would share a room and our roommate would pay for her room) so that GF and I would pay 900/each. I thought this is reasonable since 900/month should be doable for her but when I floated this idea she really pushed back hard and said since I'm making a decent salary we should get a better place and split costs proportionally. She looked something up which was a studio at 2500/month and told me we should pay $2100/$400 to reflect our income disparity.

I'm a Belgian teenager (16) and after the winter holidays, there was a new kid in our school. He is in the same class as my 2 best friends. They were complaining about him because according to them he's really boring and annoying. At first he followed one of the cool kids around but he just ignored and avoided him. By accident, I happen to stand next to him and decide to talk to him. He seemed a bit socially akward but not as bad as I imagined him to be. After our talk we move on.\n","\n","The next day, we have recess and it's the only time our whole group can be together. After a couple of minutes of catching up with my friends, I notice the new kid standing behind me outside of our group listening to us while he was on his phone texting some people. Once my friends saw him as well they started to make eye contact with me. One of my friend decided to walk away and at first I was confused but I followed him and so did the rest of our group and the new kid. My friends got pissed that he followed them but they just kept ignoring him, moving from spot to spot. I thought that this couldn't go on so I talked to the new kid and took him away from our group. I introduced him to some new people outside of our group and I told those People (after introducing him) to take good care of him because he's new. The group I introduced him to are friends that I know like to take care of the new kids so I thought that it might work out. Later that day, during lunch, I saw the new kid hanging out with that group so I thought this mess was over.\n","\n","Today during recess I realize that the new kid is standing behind me again and one of my friends decides to bail again. But this time the rest stays and the new kid comes to stand in our circle. He is on his phone texting and occasionally joins our conversation By asking one question and then he goed back to textinh on his phone. I know he didn't mean to be rude but it really came over that way. Evertone realises that he's here but doesn't do anything about it. After a couple of minutes of akward silence I decide to Tell him that certain members of our group are not fond of him and that it was maybe better that he hung out with the other group. I take him to the group again and introduce him once more (there were different People in the group than the ones he met yesterday) and I informed them about the situation. They obviously said that I just wanted to drop him of here so I wouldn't be bothered. My defence was that if the new kid were to stay in our group that there would be trouble and such. (Which I didn't make up, I actually think that could have happened). I told them to really take care of him because he's new and I apologized to the new kid. He seemed disappointed but not mad.\n","\n","I just feel like that introducing him to new group and maybe letting him make some actual friends over there would be better than you say nothing and keep ignoring him in our group. It's obviously my mistake because I shouldn't have been so inviting as my friends told me later.\n","\n","\n","\n","kicking the new kid out of our group\n","\n","\n","Are the author's actions ethically justified?

My parents are divorced since I was a toddler. In my childhood, my father was never really supporting me, providing me and my mom with 300 bucks a month until I was 18. My mother had to give up college and everything to raise me and take up odd jobs to get us through. He was making at least 3000 during that time but that’s another story. \n","\n","I’m 27 now. Going to law school here in my country. Since I’m 18, my dad puts money on my account, around 500 each month, now it’s 1200 dollars. For the bar exam alone, you study at least 1 1/2 years with 9-10 hours a day. Which makes working next to impossible. I was fired from my last job because I could never complete my hours. He also lets me drive a company car for free. \n","\n","Now, my father is an income millionaire nowadays. He has another child and woman and lives in the richest area of my city (comparable to Bel Air or Beverly Hills in Los Angeles). I know 1200 is a lot, and sometimes I feel like he shouldn’t support me. The thing is, he’s still my father and my mom lets me live rent free too and buys all groceries. She raised me. \n","\n","The thing why I’m feeling like an asshole is, I don’t talk to him. We have a very bad relationship. He is very abusive. I’m balding and whenever we see each other he keeps on telling me I’m a bald head. He says I’m a failure in life. He says he regretted having me when I was born while he was still a student. He told his friends I was his nephew when I was little because he was embarrassed to have a child. He still talks bad about my mom. Bad about me where ever he can. When I complain about my studies, he says I’m exaggerating. He says I look old. When I went to take pictures for my license for after the exam he told me I wouldn’t get a job like this. Basically, he takes any chance he gets to say bad things about me. On my birthdays, he just writes emails. He makes me feel bad for not spending my birthday with him and his wife and eat ice cream outside (wtf?) and betraying him because I want to spend time with my mothers side of the family because they actually care for me. \n","\n","There are multiple times where we didn’t talk to each other for longer periods. Every time after he just acted like I was the asshole and I’m not a man for not talking to him. He makes me feel bad that I don’t care for his (spoiled) daughter who doesn’t even care for me. Me and my mom had to move in the middle of my exam last year. My mom paid for everything, new bed, table etc. Even my gf father helped. He or his wife didn’t do anything. Not even financially. He just gave me a moving box. This was a very stressful time which led me to have some stress related health issues. \n","\n","He sent me to one of his friends after a doctor said I might have cancer (which I don’t thankfully). The guy wanted to give me anti depressants because he said I was making it all up. My dad said take them without any thought even though I told him his friend didn’t even talk to me before prescribing those. After that, I was diagnosed with GERD by another doctor. I asked my dad to drive me but he wouldn’t take time off work and then got angry because I told him when he doesn’t have time my mom will drive me in an angry way too. Since then, he hasn’t called me once. He didn’t ask about the results by the doctor. How I feel. Anything. I haven’t congratulated him on Christmas either or New Years because I just don’t wanna talk to him anymore for all the abusive things he does to me. He excludes me from his life and only kept calling me in the past because of guilt issues or to keep a facade for his younger daughter I guess. He got a license plate with her name for his new car. He never even acknowledged me in front of other people. He doesn’t even know what my friends names are even though he knows everything about her life. He still boasts about he once went to see my teacher in 7th grade as if he took an interest in my life. \n","\n","Sorry for the long text... and sorry for the shit English. I hope my text makes sense. Well, the question is, am I the asshole for still relying on my dads money even though I hate him and don’t talk to him and not visit him and his family? And especially for my age? I feel like a failure but I also feel that’s still my biological father and I didn’t ask to come into this world... and he has the money and brags all the time how he makes so much money..\n","\n","still asking my dad for money\n","\n","\n","Are the author's actions ethically justified?

I feed him, walk him, and play so god damn much with him. He's a great little guy.\n","\n","He's taking to the potty training but fuck does he need to learn to come when he's called. \n","\n","Usually there is always someone around so that he doesn't have to be locked up for very long. We have a corner of the kitchen blocked off with a gate with plenty of room for a pee pad if no on is home, waterbowl, bed, area to walk around and toys. I usually come home from work for lunch so I'll let him out to do his business and play with him while I eat. \n","\n","When I'm home from work, he's on my heel at all times and follows me everywhere. I'm constantly throwing his toys for him to enthusiastically fetch and having my hand eaten when he decides that it's time for his weak little ass to beat the shit out of me (playfully btw, he never bites just roughhouses). \n","\n","This goes on for hours and hours regardless of what I'm doing or how long of a walk I've taken him on. His energy never drains and he's always ready to keep playing, even running around your feet when you get up to do anything. \n","\n","By the time 10pm hits, I need a break and as much as I try to pawn him off to other people, he always seeks me out. I love him and it's clear that I'm \"his person\" but as he's still relatively new to the home I feel like I need to be vigilant in making sure he's not getting into anything or peeing (despite taking him out regularly).\n","\n","After a few hours of playing, I lock him up in the kitchen after taking him out to pee and retreat to go watch tv/play a game before I had to go to bed to be up early for work in the morning. Every whine and cry I hear from him breaks my heart (he's a floor below and isn't too loud) but I just want to be able to focus on something without having to make sure he isn't eating anything that might hurt him. \n","\n","AITA for \"putting him to bed\" early just to have some time for myself?\n","\n","caging off my dog when I don't want to watch him\n","\n","\n","Are the author's actions ethically justified?

I've known Barb for about 8 months, and she offered me a place to stay with no hesitation. She's been a pretty good friend to me, but like the rest of us isn't without her faults - she's got a history of some very creative lies about situations that (in my opinion) are very obviously lies and don't even need to be made up. \n","\n","A few days ago, I was checking my bank accounts online and noticed a transaction ~$380 from an airline. I originally thought nothing of it, but began to have suspicions the more I thought of it - Barb has previously mentioned that this is her favorite airline and she only flies with them.\n","\n","The same day, I left for work and noticed another large transaction ~$550 on my account from a fruit-based technology company. I don't have any products from this company, but Barb owns several. Throughout the day, I continue to monitor my account. Another transaction of ~$160 comes through, this time from \"PayPal [Barb's first name_last name]\". \n","\n","I immediately called my bank to report the transactions as fraudulent, and they also reported a ~$100 transaction to Sprint wireless (which is Barb's carrier; I have another mobile carrier). The agent on the line told me that all of the transactions were done online, between the previous night and that morning. \n","\n","Fast-forward to today and I have been keeping silent while securing housing elsewhere, not sure if I should file a police report and risk retaliation or settle for having the bank return my funds, move out, and cut ties with Barb. She left town for the holidays this morning; and texted me asking if something was wrong because I've been acting distant the past few days.\n","\n","I responded that I knew she had taken my credit card (I naively leave my wallet on the kitchen table while sleeping) and made many transactions on it, that I was angry and feel betrayed, and that I will be moving out by the end of the week.\n","\n","Her many responses include that she's offended I would accuse her of stealing from me, that she never borrows money from anyone, has been independent for many years, etc. She's even offered to repay \"however much I think she stole from me.\" However, because of the circumstances and her history of not being truthful, I find it hard to believe her (although if I'm completely honest, I'd like this situation to have another explanation).\n","\n","So - am I the asshole?\n","\n","calling my (former) friend a thief and cutting her out of my life\n","\n","\n","Are the author's actions ethically justified?

Also, sorry for the long post, but I felt like a detailed timeline would be best. Anyway, here goes:\n","\n","I broke up with my ex after dating her for a month and a half. The reason I broke up with her at the time was because I felt like she was becoming manipulative. She had mental health issues I tried my best to help her with, but the emotional burden was getting really heavy on me especially since she would guilt trip me/threaten to self harm/threaten to kill herself if I wasn't able to satisfy her need for validation, etc. While I wanted to help, I felt like I was not in a good position to do so. \n","\n","When I broke up with her over call, it actually went pretty well and I thought we could end on good terms. An hour after the breakup, she texted me \"oh by the way, I cheated on you lol\" (almost verbatim) which made me angry as shit. Particularly because the way she said it made it sound like she didn't care and specifically tried to spite me. Turns out a few weeks into our relationship she made out with some guy at some party while drunk, and I was out of the country. \n","\n","I told her how angry I was, but after a few hours she messaged me again saying she didn't actually cheat on me and it was just something she made up to hurt my feelings. Why she would make something like that up is beyond me, but I told her her manipulative behavior plus her immaturity meant I didn't care if she was lying or not, I was done with her. \n","\n","After that, I tried to cut off communication. She would still message me, literally threatening to kill herself if I didn't reply, and even went to the length of sending me suicide notes and sending pictures of the building she wanted to jump off. This was super fucking alarming, but I also felt like she was trying to manipulate me into staying, so I had to tread carefully. I told her to please get professional help because I couldn't help her anymore, and then stopped replying. \n","\n","After a few weeks, she messaged me saying she got professional help because of the breakup, and she thanked me for that. I replied that I was happy for her, but stopped replying again to continue to keep distance from her. Sometime after this I found out from one of our mutual friends that she wasn't lying about cheating on me after all, so I got angry again and really didn't reply to her messages.\n","\n","Over the next few weeks, she would message me almost every other night, first sending me Christmas greetings which I didn't reply to. Then she got increasingly angry, she started asking if we could please talk because I was making her have anxiety attacks every night, which I still didn't reply to. She said she just wanted to know what she did wrong, which I felt like I already detailed in the breakup and after it. After a long time of this happening, I decided to just message her that I had nothing more to say and I didn't owe her anything because of how she treated me. She continued to message after this, and I decided to block her on Facebook.\n","\n","I hadn't heard from her in a couple of days until today, when she messaged me on Twitter (I hadn't blocked her there) and told me something. She said that she had wanted to tell me this since December, but the fact that she \"cheated on me\" wasn't the full story. She said she only found out later on that at that party where she was drunk, she didn't willingly make out with the dude but was forced into it. She only found out about this afterwards because she wasn't fully conscious that night. She said that I didn't let her tell her side of the story, and that I was making her lose sleep and fuck me for being so stubborn.\n","\n","I had no idea that was the case, because when she told me she just said she cheated on me. I feel terrible for her having to go through that. At the same time, I had no way of knowing the truth there because she told me a different version of it. I kind of feel like she's gonna tell her friends (in our shared friends circle) that I'm an asshole for breaking up with her and treating her like that after having to go through such a thing. AITA for being mad at her, ignoring her, etc. when it turns out I didn't know the full story? \n","\n","not realizing my ex was sexually harassed\n","\n","\n","Are the author's actions ethically justified?

We’re both attending college about an hour train ride away from one another and make it a point to see each other at least 3 nights a week (Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday or Sunday) and I always spend the night at her place because she has a cat to care for. \n","\n","Last Saturday I had made plans to compete in the Nintendo Super Smash Bros Online tournament, and not knowing how long it would take, decided to make plans with my girlfriend to see each other the following day to watch the Super Bowl at my place and then go back to her place after. The tournament ends earlier than I expected it to, and I check my phone to see a text from a friend of mine who’s a girl. She wants to know if I’d go with her to the grand opening of a Milkbar (really good ice cream) in the Harvard area. I say yes, swing by her dorm, and we take the train over together. I’ll preface by saying this before any comments ask: I’m not attracted to this girl, at all, but we have great conversations and I don’t have very many other friends at college besides my suitemates. \n","\n","It hasn’t crossed my mind to tell my girlfriend where I’m going or who I’m with, as we’re on the train we just send snaps of our faces back and forth. When we get to the Harvard stop I get a snap asking where I was, I respond that I’m going to the Milkbar opening. She follows up asking if I’m going “alone?” I respond with a snap of me and my friend smiling. \n","\n","We get in line for the opening and my girlfriend starts sending snap after snap, berating me that I’m “Okay waiting in line for the Milkbar for hours but won’t go to the art museum with her” or “Can do that but act annoyed about going in with her to Forever 21.” Earlier in the week she asked if I wanted to go to the local Art Museum with her on Saturday and I said no because I wasn’t sure how long the Saturday tournament would last for. The Forever 21 thing is true though, I hate going into that store for upwards of an hour.\n","\n","While we’re in line I tell my friend about how my girlfriend is jealous, and she comments about how that’s kinda crazy and I should dump her. I defend her, saying that she’s not always like this and how there’s more to our relationship than just this one instance.
